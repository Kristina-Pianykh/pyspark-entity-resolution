MOOD [Dog 94b] is developed on the Exodus Storage Manager (ESM) [ESM 92] and therefore some of the kernel functions like storage management, concurrency control, backup and recovery of data were readily available through ESM. In addition ESM has a client-server architecture and each MOOD process is a client application in ESM. The kernel functions provided by MOOD are the optimization and interpretation of SQL statements, dynamic linking of functions, and catalog management. SQL statements are interpreted whereas functions (which have been previously compiled with C++) within SQL statements are dynamically linked and executed. A query optimizer is implemented by using the Volcano Query Optimizer Generator. A graphical user interface, namely Mood-View [Arp 93a, Arp 93b], is developed using Motif. MoodView displays both the schema information and the query results graphically. Additionally it is possible to update the database schema and to traverse the references in query results graphically.The system is coded in GNU C++ on Sun Sparc 2 workstations. MOOD has a SQL-like object-oriented query language, namely MOODSQL [Ozk 93b, Dog 94c]. MOOD type system is derived from C++, thus eliminating the impedance mismatch between MOOD and C++. The users can also access the MOOD Kernel from their application programs written in C++. For this purpose MOOD Kernel defines a class named UserRequest that contains a method for the execution of MOODSQL statements. The MOOD source code is available both for anonymous ftp users from ftp.cs.wisc.edu and for the WWW users from the site http://www.srdc.metu.edu.tr along with its related documents.In MOOD, each object is given a unique Object Identifier (OID) at object creation time by the ESM which is the disk start address of the object returned by the ESM. Object encapsulation is considered in two parts, method encapsulation and attribute encapsulation. These encapsulation properties are similar to the public and private declarations of C++.Methods can be defined in C++ by users to manipulate user defined classes and after compilation, they are dynamically linked and executed during the interpretation of SQL statements. This late binding facility is essential since database environments enforce run-time modification of schema and objects. With our approach, the interpretation of functions are avoided thus increasing the efficiency of the system. Dynamic linking primitives are implemented by the use of the shared object facility of SunOS [Sun 90]. Overloading is realized by making use of the signature concept of C++."	#*Implementation Aspects of an Object-Oriented DBMS. #@Asuman Dogac, Mehmet Altinel, Cetin Ozkan, Ilker Durusoy #t1995 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b95bb7602d9704549f06 #%53e9b9c7b7602d97045be60c

"#*Addressing techniques used in database object managers O2 and ORION #@André Gamache, Nadjiba Sahraoui #t1995 #cACM SIGMOD Record #index539087cf20f70186a0d5b53e #!Addressing mechanisms used by the new generation of Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) differ significantly from traditional ones. Such changes are the direct result of new applications requirements such as office information systems (OIS) and computer aided design (CAD). In this context, object format requires different representations on disk and in main memory, and this is often valid for interobject references. It is evident that these mechanisms are closely linked to the mode of object-identity implementation, as well as clustering strategies. All of these functions are controlled by the object manager.This article describes these mechanisms through the implementation of two object managers for object-oriented DBMS: O2 and ORION. We show how the performance of these systems depends on their memory management and addressing scheme. The two managers to be discussed merges techniques proposed by both data base field and object-oriented programming field. Their own mechanism differs, according to the way it handles distribution. ORION-1SX and O2 have a Client/Server architecture, but each one uses a different approach for distributing of functionalities. ORION-1SX implements an object-server, whereas O2 uses a page-server approach. An analysis of the two systems shows that they both use a two-level addressing mechanism. buffer management for objects in memory is diffent and more complex in ORION. On the other hand, the clustering strategies in O2 have the advantage of being more dynamic and can be specified outside the schema."	#*Addressing Techniques Used in Database Object Managers O2 and Orion. #@André Gamache, Nadjiba Sahraoui #t1995 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9a0fbb7602d97029e46ea

Meta information systems, also called repositories, document and coordinate the distributed processes of producing, integrating, operating, and evolving database-intensive applications.Our research approaches these problems from a technological and from an application perspective.On the one hand, we pursue theory and system aspects of the integration of deductive and object-oriented technologies. One outcome of this work is a deductive object manager called ConceptBase which has been developed over the past eight years and is currently used by many research groups and industrial teams throughout the world.On the other hand, a wide range of application-driven projects aims at building a sound basis of empirical knowledge about the demands on meta information systems, and about the quality of proposed solutions. They address application domains as diverse as requirements engineering, telecommunications, cooperative engineering, organization-wide quality management, evolution of chemical production processes, and medical knowledge management. They share the vision of supporting wide-area distributed cooperation not just by low-level interoperation technology but by exploiting conceptual product and process modeling.Under the direction of M. Jarke, Informatik V comprises three research groups with a total of twenty senior researchers and doctoral students: distributed information systems (leader: Dr. Manfred Jeusfeld), process information systems (Dr. Klaus Pohl), and knowledge-based systems (Prof. Wolfgang Nejdl).

"#*Condition handling in SQL persistent stored modules #@Jeff Richey #t1995 #cACM SIGMOD Record #index539087cf20f70186a0d5b545 #!The national and international standards committees responsible for Database Language SQL have proposed a candidate extension for SQL Persistent Stored Modules (SQL/PSM). The purpose of this extension is to provide a computationally complete language for the declaration and invocation of SQL stored modules and routines. Typically, such routines are stored in a database Server and executed from an application Client in a Client/Server environment.The proposed SQL/PSM consists of syntax and semantics for variable and cursor declarations, function and procedure (routines) invocations, condition handling, and control statements for looping and branching. An SQL routine is block structured, with each block consisting of local variable and condition handler declarations, a list of SQL statements, and local condition handler execution.Condition handling is a major new feature of SQL/PSM (henceforth referred to as PSM), although the style and comprehensiveness of the specification is still an issue in further progression of the standard. The specification currently under ballot includes conditions for exceptions, warnings, and other completions such as success of no data, and handlers for Continue, Exit, Redo, and Undo.Condition handling allows the user to separate condition handling code from the main flow of a routine, thereby eliminating the need to write numerous short and redundant code fragments to handle each unique condition. In some database products, one cannot even resolve the condition in the Server and must instead resort to the Client application program for resolution. Such approaches are often tedious, error-prone, and inflexible. Condition handling in the SQL module avoids these expensive alternatives, instead allowing the procedure to resolve its own conditions and then resume processing.Condition handling allows one to centralize the handling of conditions and gives users control over two major areas: run-time recovery from failures, and effects of conditions on transactions.Run-time recovery from failures has the following characteristics:• allows a user to handle any run-time condition, either by exiting gracefully or by attempting recovery• provides a recovery mechanism that includes the ability to resolve a condition and then resume action at the statement that caused the condition to be raised (if it was resolved)• provides the ability to define what \"code\" will handle each conditionAfter a condition has been resolved, what is the state of the transaction? Condition handling must ensure that the SQL-data, schemas, and SQL-variables are all maintained in an appropriate stable state and can be committed or rolled back. Additionally, the transaction must comply with the ACID test rules.Thus, the benefits of condition handling include:• allows reduction of error recovery code• creates a model for trapping and resolving conditions• provides the ability to resolve the condition and if possible to continue on• avoids the cost of requiring the SQL-client to resolve the condition• provides for greater data and path consistency in handling conditions• separates one condition from another"	#*Condition Handling in SQL Persistent Stored Modules. #@Jeff Richey #t1995 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b4d9b7602d9703ffe516

Feedback from initial user trials with a dual-paradigm version of the system indicates that users can use it to perform complex query tasks without difficulty, that given the choice users overwhelmingly prefer the graph- based to the text-based interaction style, and that graphical visualisation of textual queries appears to aid users in query construction."	#*Design and User Testing of a Multi-Paradigm Query Interface to an Object-Oriented Database. #@Dac Khoa Doan, Norman W.

We decided to focus on central approaches, concepts, methods, and systems in the area of active databases. It does not contain entries in the area of \"pure\" real-time, object-oriented, temporal, and deductive databases. But we did include publications related to those approaches, as long as they discuss active databases.We divided the material into various sections following our own personal perception of the field. The sections provide an overview on different projects in the area of active databases, followed by sections on relevant research topics. Each section contains a few remarks followed by a list of cross references into the annotated bibliography. Papers might appear in more than one section in case they discuss different topics relevant to different sections.Additionally, when relevant we also included unpublished, but publicly available material. For those papers we included information how to obtain them from the authors or from the organizations where the were produced.The beauty of our work is the individual annotation to almost all publications. Due to space limitations we are forced to leave out those annotations in the version published here. For a complete annotated bibliography we refer to the entry in our WWW server.The effort to build up such a bibliography is an endless task. Since we believe it now provides a comprehensive overview on the existing literature in the field, we decided to publish it. However, we invite all readers to add remarks, corrections, updates, additions (including further annotations).Part of this work was done while we were associated with the FORWISS Institute of the Technical University of Munich.

Data requested by a query are sometimes available in multiple sites such that the query becomes executable in different ways. Under this circumstance, choosing the best execution plan becomes an important task for optimizing the query execution. Until today, however, query optimization in multidatabase systems has not been discussed much in the literature. In this work, we utilize the knowledge of scope relationship of relations in multidatabases to identify the sites that will return the same results. Then, we propose a novel way of optimizing queries which takes advantage of the conflicts of schemas in searching for the execution plan with the least execution cost. We achieve the goal by first classifying various schema conflicts into different types. The costs of executing the same relational operation on relations of conflicting schemas are evaluated and a weight is assigned to each of the cases to reflect the complexity of executing the operation. As this method only involves simple iterative computations of the weights and the saving of a query execution time can be dramatic, the method developed here can be regarded as an effective way of optimizing query processing in a multidatabase environment."	#*An Aspect of Query Optimization in Multidatabase Systems (Extended Abstract). #@Chiang Lee, Chia-Jung Chen, Hongjun Lu #t1995 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b5e6b7602d9704135d30

However, the normalization process for an object class cannot be the same as that of a relation, because of the distinct characteristics of an object-oriented data model such as complex attributes, collection data types, and the usage of object identifiers in place of relational key attributes. We need only one kind of dependency proposed here -- the object functional dependency -- which specifies the dependency of object attributes with respect to the object identifier. We also propose the object normal form of an object class, for which all determinants of object functional dependencies are object identifiers. There is no risk of update anomalies as long as all object classes are in the object normal form."	#*Normalization in OODB Design. #@Byung Suk Lee #t1995 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e99a74b7602d97022e39e2

The EDS is composed of two parts: the Database Building Program (DBP), and the Database Querying Program (DQP). DBP reads in a dictionary encoded in SGML tags, and builds a database composed of a collection of trees which holds dictionary entries, and several lists which contain items of various lexical categories. With text exchangeability introduced by the SGML, DBP is able to accommodate dictionaries of different languages with different structures, after easy modification of a configuration file. The tree model, the Category Lists, and an optimization procedure enables DQP to quickly accomplish complicated queries, including context requirements, via simple SQL-like syntax and straightforward search methods. Results show that compared with relational database, DQP enjoys much higher speed and flexibility.

Finally, theembedding of databases into interactive work environments - forinstance, the use of databases in cooperative environments(computer supported cooperative work) - forces the databasecommunity to reconsider some of the traditional beliefs aboutdatabases.The Database Group at Hagen University has felt theseapplication pressures in various projects for quite a time. As aconsequence the emphasis of our research has shifted from databasecore technology to application oriented research. Where the formerresearch projects were mainly centered around concurrency control,recovery, distribution, and other \"classical\" database topics, thenew research projects are concerned with the support of designenvironments, where design includes all activities of developingcomplex artifacts and, in addition, usually involves thecooperation of a variety of people. Design here includes areas likemechanical CAD, software engineering, VLSI-design, multimediaproduction and many others. A characteristic of design in all theseareas is the use of a variety of heterogeneous tools which leads tocomplicated interoperability and integration issues.A key motivating factor in our work on design-environments isconcurrent engineering which certainly is one of today's majorindustrial challenges. For computer science it opens new problems,and at the same time it requires integration of different fields.The above mentioned new requirements for databases apply inprominent ways, including the issues of managing complex data,interoperability and integration, and support of teamwork.The second research area is distributed learning environments.We are working towards systems that in future will offer, in anintegrated way, computer based training and multimedia learningmaterial, access to all sorts of information bases, communicationfacilities, conferencing systems, and simulation, experimentationand exercising environments. Such systems are not only importantfor the changing needs of university education (first of allcontinuing education), but also for industrial education andtraining systems, especially in geographically decentralizedorganizations. While this work is not a primarily database centeredone, databases play a key role as the repositories for distributedhypermedia information.Part of our work in this second research area involvesdeveloping advanced teaching material for computer based learningin computer science, and in cooperation with other faculties, inareas like mathematics, humanities, economy, and history.The Database Group in Hagen, including the computer basedlearning group, consists of about 20 scientists and technicians.About half of these are financed by research and developmentcontracts. A special unit is concerned with technology transfer anddatabase testing for certain types of applications. Closelyconnected to the Database Group is the Institute forAutomation, Production and Information Management. Thisinstitute was founded by three different groups of HagenUniversity: an economics group with a special background in PPS, anautomation group with the key area robotics, and our group.

We concentrate on a commonly occurring type of join known as a star-join, although the method presented will generalize to any type of multi-table join. A star-join consists of a central detail table with large cardinality, such as an orders table (where an order row contains a single purchase) with foreign keys that join to descriptive tables, such as customers, products, and (sales) agents. The method presented in this note uses join indices with compressed bitmap representations, which allow predicates restricting columns of descriptive tables to determine an answer set (or foundset) in the central detail table; the method uses different predicates on different descriptive tables in combination to restrict the detail table through compressed bitmap representations of join indices, and easily completes the join of the fully restricted detail table rows back to the descriptive tables. We outline realistic examples where the combination of these techniques yields substantial performance improvements over alternative, more traditional query evaluation plans."	#*Multi-Table Joins Through Bitmapped Join Indices. #@Patrick E.

There are two key findings in the study. Firstly, lock granularity adopted by identical job classes should not differ from each other by a factor of more than 20; otherwise, serious data contention may result. Secondly, short job class transactions are generally benefited when its level of granularity is similar to that of the long job class since this will reduce the additional lock overhead and data contention which are induced by multigranularity locking."	#*Multigranularity Locking in Multiple Job Classes Transaction Processing System. #@Shan-hoi Ng, Sheung-lun Hung #t1995 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e99b26b7602d97023bfae5 #%53e9af75b7602d97039ba999 #%53e9ab00b7602d9703484bd6 #%53e9ac6ab7602d970363e4da #%53e9983db7602d970206972f #%53e99c59b7602d970250887d #%53e9a034b7602d9702917f61

These two changes have made mobile computer systems feasible. While there has been much research interest devoted to mobile computer issues, such systems have not yet been commercially successful. This has been ascribed to the lack of a killer mobile app. We believe that the support of video on mobile systems will indeed make possible many new interesting applications.However, providing mobile video is a non-trivial task, and much work needs to be done before practical systems are widely available. In this short note we address the issue of mobile multimedia from a practitioner's perspective. We note what software and hardware are currently available in the market in support of mobile multimedia, and point out some of their deficiencies. We also discuss some of the communication and data management research issues that need to be tackled in order to address said deficiencies.

We describe a new technique called \"Broadcast Disks\" for structuring the broadcast in a way that provides improved performance for non-uniformly accessed data. The Broadcast Disk superimposes multiple disks spinning at different speeds on a single broadcast channel--in effect creating an arbitrarily fine-grained memory hierarchy. In addition to proposing and defining the mechanism, a main result of this work is that exploiting the potential of the broadcast structure requires a re-evaluation of basic cache management policies. We examine several \"pure\" cache management policies and develop and measure implementable approximations to these policies. These results and others are presented in a set of simulation studies that substantiates the basic idea and develops some of the intuitions required to design a particular broadcast program."	#*Broadcast Disks: Data Management for Asymmetric Communications Environments. #@Swarup Acharya, Rafael Alonso, Michael J.

Norrie #t1995 #cSIGMOD '95 Proceedings of the 1995 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data #index539087d420f70186a0d5df68 #!In response to pressures to reduce product lead times,manufacturing companies are increasingly aware of the need for someform of integration along the whole product chain. Engineeringtasks must be coordinated and data exchanged between the variousspecialised tools. An enterprise has two main tracks of informationflow, namely technical and managerial, and product data managementspans both tracks. On the technical track, applications are highlyspecialised supporting tasks such as product design (CAD) and theprogramming of numerically controlled machines (CAM). Generally,the various application systems on the technical track are referredto as CAx systems. CAx systems may not only differ in terms offunctionality but also in terms of the amount and type of datamanaged, the run-time environment and performance characteristics.For complete support of Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM),we must be able to integrate existing technical and administrativecomponent application systems. These component systems vary intheir data management support and many CAx systems store their datadirectly in files rather than in a database system. The issues arehow to describe the dependencies between these component systemsand ensure system-wide data consistency. A particularly difficultproblem is that of how to interface existing application systems insuch a way that their operation can be monitored and controlled anda global transaction scheme provided.Integration must be achieved in a way that supports systemevolution in terms of the introduction and replacement ofapplication systems. This is particularly important given the trendtowards the notions of the extended enterprise and virtualfactories in which a particular product chain may span severalenterprises. Further, emerging legal statutes (especially inrelation to environmental factors) are resulting in changes to therequirements for product data management. Enterprise integrationmust be both flexible and dynamic. The best way of achieving thisis to integrate component systems by mans of a control layer whichcoordinates tasks based on explicit inter-system dependenciesamenable to both direct view and update.Product Data Management systems (also known as EngineeringDatabases) have been developed for the integration of CAx systemsby managing product data centrally. One problem with a centralisedsystem controlling access to data is that its availability iscritical to the operation of all component systems. In an effort toovercome this, systems are being developed which replicate themetadata and data required for coordination.Alternatively, coordination approaches have been proposed whichaim to maximise component subsystem autonomy and increase CIMsystem flexibility. These systems place less emphasis on datasharing and more emphasis on task coordination. The integrationeffort is minimised and only that information strictly essential tocoordination is managed centrally."	#*Integration Approaches for CIM. #@Moira C.

Digital library systems currently envision users as being static when they access information. But it is expected in the near future that tens of millions of users will have access to a digital library through wireless access. Providing digital library services to users whose location is constantly changing, whose network connections are through a wireless medium, and whose computing power is low necessitates modifications to existing digital library systems. In this paper, we identify the issues that arise when users are mobile, classify queries that are specific to mobile users and introduce an architecture that supports flexible and transparent access to digital libraries for mobile users. The main features of the architecture include a layered data representation, support of adaptability, dual broadcast and on demand querying, caching, and mobile-specific user interfaces."	#*Digital Library Services in Mobile Computing. #@Bharat K.

Thus, we can subsequently use highly fine-tuned spatial access methods (SAMs), to answer several types of queries, including the 'Query By Example' type (which translates to a range query); the 'all pairs' query (which translates to a spatial join [8]); the nearest-neighbor or best-match query, etc.However, designing feature extraction functions can be hard. It is relatively easier for a domain expert to assess the similarity/distance of two objects. Given only the distance information though, it is not obvious how to map objects into points.This is exactly the topic of this paper. We describe a fast algorithm to map objects into points in some k-dimensional space (k is user-defined), such that the dis-similarities are preserved. There are two benefits from this mapping: (a) efficient retrieval, in conjunction with a SAM, as discussed before and (b) visualization and data-mining: the objects can now be plotted as points in 2-d or 3-d space, revealing potential clusters, correlations among attributes and other regularities that data-mining is looking for.We introduce an older method from pattern recognition, namely, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) [51]; although unsuitable for indexing, we use it as yardstick for our method. Then, we propose a much faster algorithm to solve the problem in hand, while in addition it allows for indexing. Experiments on real and synthetic data indeed show that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than MDS, (being linear, as opposed to quadratic, on the database size N), while it manages to preserve distances and the overall structure of the data-set."	#*FastMap: A Fast Algorithm for Indexing, Data-Mining and Visualization of Traditional and Multimedia Datasets. #@Christos Faloutsos, King-Ip Lin #t1995 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b30ab7602d9703dd2d86 #%53e9b9bab7602d97045b0373 #%53e9a8b0b7602d97031fe399 #%53e9bdd4b7602d9704a81ede #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e9b7e0b7602d970438df55 #%53e9987db7602d97020b5e4b #%53e9b30ab7602d9703dd2d86 #%53e99f50b7602d9702823c31 #%53e9b98bb7602d970457e996 #%53e9a8ffb7602d970325074e #%53e997b9b7602d9701f9d968 #%53e99f42b7602d9702810ff0 #%53e9a272b7602d9702b76523 #%53e9b655b7602d97041b27b8 #%53e9b102b7602d9703b803ea #%53e99e30b7602d97026f22aa

The proposed LyriC language is designed to provide a uniform and flexible framework for diverse application realms such as (1) constraint-based design in two-, three-, or higher-dimensional space, (2) large-scale optimization and analysis, based mostly on linear programming techniques, and (3) spatial and geographic databases. LyriC extends flat constraint query languages, especially those for linear constraint databases, to structurally complex objects. The extension is based on the object-oriented paradigm, where constraints are treated as first-class objects that are organized in classes. The query language is an extension of the language XSQL, and is built around the idea of extended path expressions. Path expressions in a query traverse nested structures in one sweep. Constraints are used in a query to filter stored constraints and to create new constraint objects."	#*The LyriC Language: Querying Constraint Objects. #@Alexander Brodsky, Yoram Kornatzky #t1995 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a562b7602d9702e85567 #%53e9b9bab7602d97045b0373

However, problems arise when failures occur. A single node (where a node refers to a processor/memory pair) crash may require a reboot of the entire shared memory system. Fortunately, shared memory multiprocessors that isolate individual node failures are currently being developed. Even with these, because of the side effects of the cache coherency protocol, a transaction executing strictly on a single node may become dependent on the validity of the memory of many nodes thereby inducing unnecessary transaction aborts. This happens when database objects, such as records, and database support structures, such as index structures and shared lock tables, are stored in shared memory.In this paper, we propose crash recovery protocols for shared memory database systems which avoid the unnecessary transaction aborts induced by the effects of using shared physical memory. Our recovery protocols guarantee that if one or more nodes crash, all the effects of active transactions running on the crashed nodes will be undone, and no effects of transactions running on nodes which did not crash will be undone. In order to show the practicality of our protocols, we discuss how existing features of cache-coherent multiprocessors can be utilized to implement these recovery protocols. Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) for many types of database objects and support structures, volatile (in-memory) logging is sufficient to avoid unnecessary transaction aborts, and (2) a very low overhead implementation of this strategy can be achieved with existing multiprocessor features."	#*Recovery Protocols for Shared Memory Database Systems. #@Lory D.

Business process re-engineering and workflow automation to coordinate activities throughout the enterprise are recognized as important emerging technologies to support these requirements. Rosy estimates of a multi-billion dollar marketplace for workflow software has resulted in significant commercial activities in the area, with nearly hundred products now claiming to support workflow automation. While many help to automate document- and image-driven office applications, therefore helping to improve the productivity of small groups, most current products fail to support:• mission critical and enterprise-wide applications with requirements such as failure handling and recovery, and• interoperability with existing heterogeneous information systems.In this tutorial, we will discuss requirements for applications involving workflow automation, present an overview of the current state-of-the-art in products, and present some of the research efforts that are attempting to respond to unmet challenges."	#*Workflow Automation: Applications, Technology, and Research (Tutorial). #@Amit P.

Virmani #t1995 #cSIGMOD '95 Proceedings of the 1995 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data #index539087d420f70186a0d5df6a #!DataMine is a statistical database mining system with strong emphasis on interactiveness and nice graphical representation of information produced. It also supports an offline mode of discovery, and provides an extensive API which allows users to write \"mining applications\" just as easily as routine database applications, The central idea is to perform discovery with a \"human in the loop\" guiding the system using his initial hypothesis and the feedback from the system. Users can pose a rule-query against a rulebase and the system can generate all rules matching their query. The rulebase could either be pregenerated (using offline mode) or could be realized in real-time as the discovery progresses.Rules generated by the system are of the form:Body -> Consequentwhere Body is a conjunction of the elementary predicates of the form (A=a), where A is an attribute and a is a value from the attribute domain of A. Consequent is a single elementary predicate. Each rule can have several parameters like support, confidence, atypicality, color etc. (the definitions have been left out) which can also be used by the user in framing the rule query.For continuous attributes, the system also allows the user some control in deciding how they are discretized. It also allows for the creation of extra attributes at run time which can then be used in queries like the rest."	#*DataMine - Interactive Rule Discovery System. #@Tomasz Imielinski, Aashu Virmani #t1995 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9ab90b7602d97035384aa #%53e9b9bab7602d97045b0373

For this indexing problem, most systems use the class hierarchy index (CH) technique of [15] implemented using B+-trees. Other techniques, such as those of [14, 18,31], can lead to improved average-case performance but involve the implementation of new data-structures. As a special form of external dynamic two-dimensional range searching, this OODB indexing problem is solvable within reasonable worst-case bounds [12]. Based on this insight, we have developed a technique, called indexing by class-division (CD), which we believe can be used as a practical alternative to CH. We present an optimized implementation and experimental validation of CD's average-case performance. The main advantages of the CD technique are: (1) CD is an extension of CH that provides a significant speed-up over CH for a wide spectrum of range queries--this speed-up is at least linear in the number of classes queried for uniform data and larger otherwise; and (2) CD queries, updates and concurrent use are implementable using existing B+-tree technology. The basic idea of class-division involves a time-space tradeoff and CD requires some space and update overhead in comparison to CH. In practice, this overhead is a small factor (2 to 3) and, in worst-case, is bounded by the depth of the hierarchy and the logarithm of its size."	#*OODB Indexing by Class-Division. #@Sridhar Ramaswamy, Paris C.

The framework is based on a special class of mediators, called Squirrel integration mediators. These mediators can support the traditional virtual and materialized approaches, and also hybrids of them.In the Squirrel mediators, a relation in the integrated view can be supported as (a) fully materialized, (b) fully virtual, or (c) partially materialized (i.e., with some attributes materialized and other attributes virtual). In general, (partially) materialized relations of the integrated view are maintained by incremental updates from the source databases. Squirrel mediators provide two approaches for doing this: (1) materialize all needed auxiliary data, so that data sources do not have to be queried when processing the incremental updates; or (2) leave some or all of the auxiliary data virtual, and query selected source databases when processing incremental updates.The paper presents formal notions of consistency and \"freshness\" for integrated views defined over multiple autonomous source databases. It is shown that Squirrel mediators satisfy these properties."	#*A Framework for Supporting Data Integration Using the Materialized and Virtual Approaches. #@Richard Hull, Gang Zhou #t1996 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b32bb7602d9703df9017 #%53e9af4db7602d970398e291 #%53e9a987b7602d97032e43db #%53e9b582b7602d97040c584b #%53e9af06b7602d970393eff2 #%53e9bce8b7602d970496ab17 #%53e9b755b7602d97042f607d #%53e9b3cdb7602d9703eb940e #%53e9b828b7602d97043e0394 #%53e9a922b7602d9703275cf9 #%53e9b32bb7602d9703df9017

Such applications typically include complex SQL queries that can test a query optimizer's ability to produce an efficient access plan. Many access plan strategies exploit the physical ordering of data provided by indexes or sorting. Sorting is an expensive operation, however. Therefore, it is imperative that sorting is optimized in some way or avoided all together. Toward that goal, this paper describes novel optimization techniques for pushing down sorts in joins, minimizing the number of sorting columns, and detecting when sorting can be avoided because of predicates, keys, or indexes. A set of fundamental operations is described that provide the foundation for implementing such techniques. The operations exploit data properties that arise from predicate application, uniqueness, and functional dependencies.

The motivation for a next generation DBMS is driven by the reality of shortened business cycles. This dynamic environment demands fast, cost-effective, time-to-market of new or modified business processes, services, and products. To support this important business need, the next generation DBMS must: 1. leverage the large investments made in existing relational technology, both in data and skill set; 2. Take advantage of the flexibility, productivity, and performance benefits of OO modeling; and 3. Integrate robust DBMS services for production quality systems. The objective of this article is to provide a brief overview of UniSQL's commercial object-relational database management system."	#*UniSQL's Next-Generation Object-Relational Database Management System. #@Albert D'Andrea, Phil Janus #t1996 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9ae22b7602d9703836aa0

It reorganizes the leaves first, compacting in short operations groups of leaves with the same parent. After compacting, optionally, the new leaves may swap locations or be moved into empty pages so that they are in key order on the disk. After the leaves are reorganized, the method shrinks the tree by making a copy of the upper part of the tree while leaving the leaves in place. A new concurrency method is introduced so that only a minimum number of pages are locked during reorganization. During leaf reorganization, Forward Recovery is used to save all work already done while maintaining consistency after system crashes. A heuristic algorithm is developed to reduce the number of swaps needed during leaf reorganization, so that better concurrency and easier recovery can be achieved. A detailed description of switching from the old B+-tree to the new B+-tree is described for the first time."	#*On-line Reorganization of Sparsely-populated B+trees. #@Chendong Zou, Betty Salzberg #t1996 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a447b7602d9702d6286f #%53e9af4db7602d970398e291

Consequently, many proposals exist for algorithms computing good object placements depending on the application profile. However, in an effective object base reorganization tool the clustering algorithm is only one constituent. In this paper, we report on our object base reorganization tool that covers all stages of reorganizing the objects: the application profile is determined by a monitoring tool, the object placement is computed from the monitored access statistics utilizing a variety of clustering algorithms and, finally, the reorganization tool restructures the object base accordingly. The costs as well as the effectiveness of these tools is quantitatively evaluated on the basis of the OO1-benchmark."	#*On the Cost of Monitoring and Reorganization of Object Bases for Clustering. #@Carsten Andreas Gerlhof, Alfons Kemper, Guido Moerkotte #t1996 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b0fbb7602d9703b764b7 #%53e9a1a9b7602d9702aa0b8b #%53e9b437b7602d9703f31a96 #%53e9aa56b7602d97033c4488 #%53e9a515b7602d9702e364a3 #%53e9983db7602d9702063375 #%53e99f86b7602d970285d67e #%53e9b74fb7602d97042ed8d1 #%53e99838b7602d9702061f2c #%53e9b999b7602d970458b4e4 #%53e9a2fbb7602d9702c07c03 #%53e99fd0b7602d97028aa07b

Among the features of WWW-UDK are several query modes for the UDK objects and addresses, an environmental thesaurus, on-line access to some of the underlying data (e.g., databases and environmental reports), multilingual query and result forms, and an on-line help system. Currently, several installations of WWW-UDK are used in Austria and in Germany on the Internet and on Intranets.

Pixel-oriented techniques use each pixel of the display to visualize one data value and therefore allow the visualization of the largest amount of data possible. The techniques may be divided into query-independent techniques which directly visualize the data (or a certain portion of it) and query-dependent techniques which visualize the relevance of the data with respect to a specific query. An example for the class of query-independent techniques is the recursive pattern technique which is based on a generic recursive scheme generalizing a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for visualizing large databases. Examples for the class of query-dependent techniques are the generalized spiral and circle-segments techniques, which visualize the distance with respect to a database query and arrange the most relevant data items in the center of the display."	#*Pixel-oriented Database Visualizations. #@Daniel A.

Image compression methods can lessen the problem by encoding digital images into more space-efficient forms. Image compression is achieved by reducing redundancy in the imaging data. Existing methods reduce redundancy in individual images. However, these methods ignore an additional source of redundancy, which is based on the common information stored in more than one image in a set of similar images. We use the term \"set redundancy\" to describe this type of redundancy. Medical image databases contain large sets of similar images, therefore they also contain significant amounts of set redundancy.This paper presents two methods that extract set redundancy from medical imaging data: the Min-Max Differential (MMD), and the Min-Max Predictive (MMP) methods. These methods can improve compression of standard image compression techniques for sets of medical images.

"#*Quasi-cubes: exploiting approximations in multidimensional databases #@Daniel Barbará, Mark Sullivan #t1997 #cACM SIGMOD Record #index539087e120f70186a0d665f7 #!A data cube is a popular organization for summary data. A cube is simply a multidimensional structure that contains at each point an aggregate value, i.e., the result of applying an aggregate function to an underlying relation. In practical situations, cubes can require a large amount of storage. The typical approach to reducing storage cost is to materialize parts of the cube on demand. Unfortunately, this lazy evaluation can be a time-consuming operation.In this paper, we describe an approximation technique that reduces the storage cost of the cube without incurring the run time cost of lazy evaluation. The idea is to provide an incomplete description of the cube and a method of estimating the missing entries with a certain level of accuracy. The description, of course, should take a fraction of the space of the full cube and the estimation procedure should be faster than computing the data from the underlying relations. Since cubes are used to support data analysis and analysts are rarely interested in the precise values of the aggregates (but rather in trends), providing approximate answers is, in most cases, a satisfactory compromise.Alternatively, the technique can be used to implement a multiresolution system in which a tradeoff is established between the execution time of queries and the errors the user is willing to tolerate. By only going to the disk when it is necessary (to reduce the errors), the query can be executed faster. This idea can be extended to produce a system that incrementally increases the accuracy of the answer while the user is looking at it, supporting on-line aggregation."	#*Quasi-Cubes: Exploiting Approximations in Multidimensional Databases. #@Daniel Barbará, Mark Sullivan #t1997 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9a13fb7602d9702a2cf10

In effect, the warehouse stores one or more materialized views of the source data. The data is then readily available to user applications for querying and analysis. Figure 1 shows the basic architecture of a warehouse: data is collected from each source, integrated with data from other sources, and stored at the warehouse. Users then access the data directly from the warehouse.As suggested by Figure 1, there are two major components in a warehouse system: the integration component, responsible for collecting and maintaining the materialized views, and the query and analysis component, responsible for fulfilling the information needs of specific end users. Note that the two components are not independent. For example, which views the integration component materializes depends on the expected needs of end users.Most current commercial warehousing systems (e.g., Redbrick, Sybase, Arbor) focus on the query and analysis component, providing specialized index structures at the warehouse and extensive querying facilities for the end user. In the WHIPS (WareHousing Information Project at Stanford) project, on the other hand, we focus on the integration component. In particular, we have developed an architecture and implemented a prototype for identifying data changes at heterogeneous sources, transforming them and summarizing them in accordance to warehouse specifications, and incrementally integrating them into the warehouse. We propose to demonstrate our prototype at SIGMOD, illustrating the main features of our architecture. Our architecture is modular and we designed it specifically to fulfill several important and interrelated goals: data sources and warehouse views can be added and removed dynamically; it is scalable by adding more internal modules; changes at the sources are detected automatically; the warehouse may be updated continuously as the sources change, without requiring “down time;” and the warehouse is always kept consistent with the source data by the integration algorithms. More details on these goals and how we achieve them are provided in [WGL+96]."	#*The WHIPS Prototype for Data Warehouse Creation and Maintenance. #@Wilburt Labio, Yue Zhuge, Janet L.

As enterprise database systems become larger and more complex, hardware vendors are building increasingly large systems capable of supporting huge memory configurations. Database vendors in turn are developing buffer schemes to exploit this physical memory.How much will these developments benefit OLTP workloads? Through empirical studies on databases sized comparably to those seen in the real-world, this paper presents the characteristics of an industry-standard OLTP benchmark as memory buffer size changes. We design the experiments to investigate how the database size, the buffer size and the number of CPUs impact performance, in particular the throughput and the buffer hit rate on Symmetric Multiprocessor Systems. The relationships of these major database attributes are plotted and key observations are summarized. We discuss how these relationships change as the number of CPUs changes. We further quantify the relationships: 1) between database buffer data hit rate, buffer size and database size, 2) between throughput, buffer data hit rate and database size and 3) between throughput and number of CPUs. Algorithms, rules-of-thumb and examples are presented for predicting performance, sizing memory and making trade-offs between adding more memory and increasing the number of CPUs."	#*Database Buffer Size Investigation for OLTP Workloads (Experience Paper). #@Thin-Fong Tsuei, Allan Packer, Keng-Tai Ko #t1997 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a9d9b7602d970333d0a1 #%53e9ae6fb7602d970388c7cd

This merge-pack has been implemented to use separate storage for writing the updated cubetrees, therefore allowing cube queries to continue even during maintenance.

We argue that very often such a performance analysis does not reflect the actual use of the DBMSs in the “real world.” End users typically don't access a stand-alone database system; rather they use a comprehensive application system, in which the database system constitutes an integrated component. In order to derive performance evaluations of practical relevance to the end users, the application system including the database system has to be benchmarked. In this paper, we present TPC-D benchmark results carried out using the SAP R/3 system, an integrated business administration system. Like many other application systems SAP R/3 is based on a commercial relational database system.

Recently, Gray et al. [GBLP95] proposed the “Cube” operator, which computes group-by aggregations over all possible subsets of the specified dimensions. The rapid acceptance of the importance of this operator has led to a variant of the Cube being proposed for the SQL standard. Several efficient algorithms for Relational OLAP (ROLAP) have been developed to compute the Cube. However, to our knowledge there is nothing in the literature on how to compute the Cube for Multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP) systems, which store their data in sparse arrays rather than in tables. In this paper, we present a MOLAP algorithm to compute the Cube, and compare it to a leading ROLAP algorithm. The comparison between the two is interesting, since although they are computing the same function, one is value-based (the ROLAP algorithm) whereas the other is position-based (the MOLAP algorithm). Our tests show that, given appropriate compression techniques, the MOLAP algorithm is significantly faster than the ROLAP algorithm. In fact, the difference is so pronounced that this MOLAP algorithm may be useful for ROLAP systems as well as MOLAP systems, since in many cases, instead of cubing a table directly, it is faster to first convert the table to an array, cube the array, then convert the result back to a table."	#*An Array-Based Algorithm for Simultaneous Multidimensional Aggregates. #@Yihong Zhao, Prasad Deshpande, Jeffrey F.

The current paper presents a short review of current indexing technology, including row-set representation by Bitmaps, and then introduces two approaches we call Bit-Sliced indexing and Projection indexing. A Projection index materializes all values of a column in RID order, and a Bit-Sliced index essentially takes an orthogonal bit-by-bit view of the same data. While some of these concepts started with the MODEL 204 product, and both Bit-Sliced and Projection indexing are now fully realized in Sybase IQ, this is the first rigorous examination of such indexing capabilities in the literature. We compare algorithms that become feasible with these variant index types against algorithms using more conventional indexes. The analysis demonstrates important performance advantages for variant indexes in some types of SQL aggregation, predicate evaluation, and grouping. The paper concludes by introducing a new method whereby multi-dimensional group-by queries, reminiscent of OLAP/Datacube queries but with more flexibility, can be very efficiently performed."	#*Improved Query Performance with Variant Indexes. #@Patrick E.

Therefore, an accurate classifier is an essential component of a hypertext database. Hyperlinks pose new problems not addressed in the extensive text classification literature. Links clearly contain high-quality semantic clues that are lost upon a purely term-based classifier, but exploiting link information is non-trivial because it is noisy. Naive use of terms in the link neighborhood of a document can even degrade accuracy. Our contribution is to propose robust statistical models and a relaxation labeling technique for better classification by exploiting link information in a small neighborhood around documents. Our technique also adapts gracefully to the fraction of neighboring documents having known topics. We experimented with pre-classified samples from Yahoo!1 and the US Patent Database2. In previous work, we developed a text classifier that misclassified only 13% of the documents in the well-known Reuters benchmark; this was comparable to the best results ever obtained. This classifier misclassified 36% of the patents, indicating that classifying hypertext can be more difficult than classifying text. Naively using terms in neighboring documents increased error to 38%; our hypertext classifier reduced it to 21%. Results with the Yahoo! sample were more dramatic: the text classifier showed 68% error, whereas our hypertext classifier reduced this to only 21%."	#*Enhanced Hypertext Categorization Using Hyperlinks. #@Soumen Chakrabarti, Byron Dom, Piotr Indyk #t1998 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a894b7602d97031e356c #%53e9bc26b7602d9704890fdd #%53e9b4d9b7602d9703ffdcce #%53e9a130b7602d9702a1dcd5 #%53e9a415b7602d9702d309fd #%53e9a6bcb7602d9702ff3895 #%53e99b10b7602d970239f91f #%53e9a194b7602d9702a88ce7 #%53e9ba28b7602d970462ff53 #%53e9aadfb7602d970346232a #%53e9a711b7602d97030453ad #%53e9b115b7602d9703b9169a #%53e9a18db7602d9702a820b9 #%53e9bbcfb7602d970481ee29 #%53e9b505b7602d97040398b2 #%53e9bc61b7602d97048dc7bd #%53e9b1eab7602d9703c7c470 #%53e99885b7602d97020bf29c #%53e9af94b7602d97039da446 #%53e9bc5bb7602d97048d6ad5 #%53e9b360b7602d9703e3b313 #%53e9b124b7602d9703ba665b #%53e9a2acb7602d9702bb4ec0 #%53e9b9dab7602d97045d3160

In this paper, we describe an approach that provides structured querying for particular types of entities, such as companies and people. Entity-based retrieval is enabled by normalizing entity references in a heuristic, type-dependent manner. The approach can be used to retrieve documents and can also be used to construct entity profiles — summaries of commonly sought information about an entity based on the documents' content.

Typical examples oflarge scientific datasets include long running simulations oftime-dependent phenomena that periodically generate snapshots oftheir state (e.g. hydrodynamics and chemical transport simulationfor estimating pollution impact on water bodies [4, 6, 20],magnetohydrodynamics simulation of planetary magnetospheres [32],simulation of a flame sweeping through a volume [28], airplane wakesimulations [21]), archives of raw and processed remote sensingdata (e.g. AVHRR [25], Thematic Mapper [17], MODIS [22]), andarchives of medical images (e.g. confocal light microscopy, CTimaging, MRI, sonography).These datasets are usually multi-dimensional. The datadimensions can be spatial coordinates, time, or experimentalconditions such as temperature, velocity or magnetic field. Theimportance of such datasets has been recognized by several databaseresearch groups and vendors, and several systems have beendeveloped for managing and/or visualizing them [2, 7, 14, 19, 26,27, 29, 31].These systems, however, focus on lineage management, retrievaland visualization of multi-dimensional datasets. They providelittle or no support for analyzing or processing these datasets --the assumption is that this is too application-specific to warrantcommon support. As a result, applications that process thesedatasets are usually decoupled from data storage and management,resulting in inefficiency due to copying and loss of locality.Furthermore, every application developer has to implement complexsupport for managing and scheduling the processing.Over the past three years, we have been working with severalscientific research groups to understand the processingrequirements for such applications [1, 5, 6, 10, 18, 23, 24, 28].Our study of a large set of applications indicates that theprocessing for such datasets is often highly stylized and sharesseveral important characteristics. Usually, both the input datasetas well as the result being computed have underlyingmulti-dimensional grids, and queries into the dataset are in theform of ranges within each dimension of the grid. The basicprocessing step usually consists of transforming individual inputitems, mapping the transformed items to the output grid andcomputing output items by aggregating, in some way, all thetransformed input items mapped to the corresponding grid point. Forexample, remote-sensing earth images are often generated byperforming atmospheric correction on several days worth of rawtelemetry data, mapping all the data to a latitude-longitude gridand selecting those measurements that provide the clearestview.In this paper, we present T2, a customizable paralleldatabase that integrates storage, retrieval and processing ofmulti-dimensional datasets. T2 provides support for many operationsincluding index generation, data retrieval, memory management,scheduling of processing across a parallel machine and userinteraction. It achieves its primary advantage from the ability toseamlessly integrate data retrieval and processing for a widevariety of applications and from the ability to maintain andprocess multiple datasets with different underlying grids. Mostother systems for multi-dimensional data have focused on uniformlydistributed datasets, such as images, maps, and densemulti-dimensional arrays. Many real datasets, however, arenon-uniform or unstructured. For example, satellite data is a twodimensional strip that is embedded in a three dimensional space;water contamination studies use unstructured meshes to selectivelysimulate regions and so on. T2 can handle both uniform andnon-uniform datasets.T2 has been developed as a set of modular services. Since itsstructure mirrors that of a wide variety of applications, T2 iseasy to customize for different types of processing. To build aversion of T2 customized for a particular application, a user hasto provide functions to pre-process the input data, map input datato elements in the output data, and aggregate multiple input dataitems that map to the same output element.T2 presents a uniform interface to the end users (the clients ofthe database system). Users specify the dataset(s) of interest, aregion of interest within the dataset(s), and the desired formatand resolution of the output. In addition, they select the mappingand aggregation functions to be used. T2 analyzes the user request,builds a suitable plan to retrieve and process the datasets,executes the plan and presents the results in the desiredformat.In Section 2 we first present several motivating applicationsand illustrate their common structure. Section 3 then presents anoverview of T2, including its distinguishing features and a runningexample. Section 4 describes each database service in some detail.An example of how to customize several of the database services fora particular application is given in Section 5. T2 is a system inevolution. We conclude in Section 6 with a description of thecurrent status of both the T2 design and the implementation ofvarious applications with T2."	#*T2: A Customizable Parallel Database for Multi-Dimensional Data. #@Chialin Chang, Anurag Acharya, Alan Sussman, Joel H.

In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying some underlying structure in large collections of semistructured data. Since we expect the data to be fairly irregular, this structure consists of an approximate classification of objects into a hierarchical collection of types. We propose a notion of a type hierarchy for such data, and outline a method for deriving the type hierarchy, and rules for assigning types to data elements."	#*Infering Structure in Semistructured Data. #@Svetlozar Nestorov, Serge Abiteboul, Rajeev Motwani #t1997 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9a952b7602d97032a6ee2

We further demonstrate that multi-database query processing techniques are also not appropriate for the problem at hand.In this paper, we describe history management, i.e., the structure of the history and querying of the history, in a fully distributed workflow architecture realized in conformance with Object Management Architecture (OMA) of OMG. By fully distributed architecture we mean that the scheduler of the workflow system is distributed and in accordance with this, the history objects related with activities are stored on data repositories (like DBMSs, files) available at the sites involved. We describe the structure of the history objects determined according to the nature of the data and the processing needs, and the possible query processing strategies on these objects using the Object Query Service of OMG.

Numerous sources contain information that can be classified as semi-structured. At present, however, the only way to access the information is by browsing individual pages. We cannot query web documents in a database-like fashion based on their underlying structure. However, we can provide database-like querying for semi-structured WWW sources by building wrappers around these sources. We present an approach for semi-automatically generating such wrappers. The key idea is to exploit the formatting information in pages from the source to hypothesize the underlying structure of a page. From this structure the system generates a wrapper that facilitates querying of a source and possibly integrating it with other sources. We demonstrate the ease with which we are able to build wrappers for a number of internet sources in different domains using our implemented wrapper generation toolkit."	#*Wrapper Generation for Semi-structured Internet Sources. #@Naveen Ashish, Craig A.

However, database applications, typically residing on client or “middle-tier” application-server machines, may lose work because of a server failure. This prevents the masking of server failures from the human user and substantially degrades application availability. This paper aims to enable high application availability with an integrated method for database server recovery and transparent application recovery in a client-server system. The approach, based on application message logging, is similar to earlier work on distributed system fault tolerance. However, we exploit advanced database logging and recovery techniques and request/reply messaging properties to significantly improve efficiency. Forced log I/Os, frequently required by other methods, are usually avoided. Restart time, for both failed server and failed client, is reduced by checkpointing and log truncation. Our method ensures that a server can recover independently of clients. A client may reduce logging overhead in return for dependency on server availability during client restart."	#*Efficient and Transparent Application Recovery in Client-Server Information Systems. #@David B.

In a joint effort, the State of Baden-Württemberg, industrial companies, the University, and the City of Ulm successfully established a research and development infrastructure at or nearby the university campus consisting of the university's research labs, university-related research institutes like the Research Institute for Applied Knowledge Processing (FAW), and industrial research and development labs, especially a large research center of Daimler-Benz AG.Today, the Faculty of Computer Science consists of seven divisions (called 'departments'), each of which equipped with two professor positions:Theoretical Computer ScienceArtificial IntelligenceDistributed SystemsDatabases and Information SystemsSoftware Technology and Compiler ConstructionComputer StructuresNeural Information Processing. The Dept. of Databases and Information Systems (DBIS) became operational at the beginning of 1990 when Peter Dadam joined the faculty. He came from the IBM Heidelberg Science Center (HDSC) where he managed the research department for Advanced Information Management (AIM). At the HDSC he was working on advanced database technology and applications and contributed to the development of the AIM-P system (see [1]).

However, adding functions to the DBMS as an integral part of them, tends to create monoliths that are difficult to design, implement, validate, maintain and adapt. Such monoliths can be avoided if one configures DBMS according to the actually needed functionality. In order to identify the basic functional components for the configuration the current monoliths should be broken up into smaller units, or in other words they could be \"unbundled\". In this paper we apply unbundling to active database systems. This results in a new form of active mechanisms where active functionality is no longer an integral part of the DBMS functionality. This allows the use of active capabilities with any arbitrary DBMS and in broader contexts. Furthermore, it allows the adaption of the active functionality to the application profile. Such aspects are crucial for a wide use of active functionality in real (database or not) applications."	#*Unbundling Active Functionality. #@Stella Gatziu, Arne Koschel, Günter von Bültzingsloewen, Hans Fritschi #t1998 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9984fb7602d97020823cf

The main objectives of this conference series are to provide a forum to address metadata issues faced by various communities, promote the interchange of ideas on common technologies and standards related to metadata, and facilitate the development and usage of metadata. Metadata'97 met these objectives, drawing about 280 registered attendees from ten different countries and over one hundred different institutions. The audience included scientists, information technology specialists, and librarians from communities as widespread as finance, climatology, and mass storage. The technical program included two keynote addresses, two panel presentations, as well as twenty-three papers and thirteen posters selected from over one hundred abstracts. We provide highlights of the conference below. For more details, the proceedings are available electronically from the conference homepage at: http://www.llnl.gov/liv_comp/metadata/md97.html.The keynote addresses were \"An Architecture for Metadata: The Dublin Core, and why you don't have to like it\" by Stuart Weibel, OCLC, and \"The Microsoft Repository\" by Philip Bernstein, Microsoft.Weibel's talk described the Dublin core and the Warwick framework - a series of workshops whose output has been a core set of metadata elements common to data from most domains, along with a \"container\" based mechanism for plugging in larger domain-specific sets of metadata, like the FGDC's standard for geospatial metadata. These efforts represent two of the defining works in this community. Weibel touched on the history of this effort and described his belief that standards such as RDF (resource description framework) for the WWW coming from organizations like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) will have a major influence on the metadata community in the near future.Bernstein's talk covered the Microsoft Object Repository, which also has the potential for a large impact on what metadata gets stored and how they are managed. Bernstein describes the repository as \"a place to persist COM objects\" (component object model), and as more than just a object-oriented database. The features of a true repository are 1) objects and properties, 2) rich relational semantics, 3) extensibility, and 4) versioning. Repositories are used to help tools interoperate by storing predefined \"information models\". The information models are the metadata used to describe the underlying COM objects in a standard way such that the objects can be shared across tool boundaries. The main consumers of this type of technology are tool vendors."	#*Report on the Second IEEE Metadata Conference (Metadata '97). #@Ron Musick, Christopher Miller 0002 #t1998 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b7cdb7602d970437bfc2

X, Y are set of attributes and A, B are fuzzy sets which describe X and Y respectively. Using the fuzzy set concept, the discovered rules are more understandable to human.

Organizations perceive a number of advantages in using the Web in enterprise computing, a particular advantage being that it provides an information representation which• supports interlinking of all kinds of content• is easy for end-users to access• supports easy content creation using widely-available toolsHowever, as organizations have attempted to employ the Web in increasingly sophisticated applications, these applications have begun to overlap in complexity the sorts of distributed applications for which distributed object architectures such as OMG's CORBA, and its surrounding Object Management Architecture (OMA) [Sol95] were originally developed. Since the Web was not originally designed to support such applications, Web application development efforts increasingly run into limitations of the basic Web infrastructure.If the Web is to be used as the basis of complex enterprise applications, it must provide generic capabilities similar to those provided by the OMA (although these may need to be adapted to the more open, flexible nature of the Web, and specific requirements of Web applications). This involves such things as providing database-like services (such as enhanced query and transaction support) and their composition in the Web. However, the basic data structuring capabilities provided by the Web (its \"object model\") must also be addressed, since the ability to define and apply powerful generic services in the Web, and the ability to generally use the Web to support complex applications, depends crucially on the ability of the Web's underlying data structuring facilities to support these complex applications and services."	#*Towards a Richer Web Object Model. #@Frank Manola #t1998 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9afeeb7602d9703a411ba

First, the site builder creates a uniform model of all data available at the site. Second, the builder uses this model to declaratively define the Web site's structure by applying a “site-definition query” to the underlying data. The result of evaluating this query is a “site graph”, which represents both the site's content and structure. Third, the builder specifies the visual presentation of pages in Strudel's HTML-template language.

These alternatives include: loose-coupling through a SQL cursor interface; encapsulation of a mining algorithm in a stored procedure; caching the data to a file system on-the-fly and mining; tight-coupling using primarily user-defined functions; and SQL implementations for processing in the DBMS. We comprehensively study the option of expressing the mining algorithm in the form of SQL queries using Association rule mining as a case in point. We consider four options in SQL-92 and six options in SQL enhanced with object-relational extensions (SQL-OR). Our evaluation of the different architectural alternatives shows that from a performance perspective, the Cache-Mine option is superior, although the performance of the SQL-OR option is within a factor of two. Both the Cache-Mine and the SQL-OR approaches incur a higher storage penalty than the loose-coupling approach which performance-wise is a factor of 3 to 4 worse than Cache-Mine. The SQL-92 implementations were too slow to qualify as a competitive option. We also compare these alternatives on the basis of qualitative factors like automatic parallelization, development ease, portability and inter-operability."	#*Integrating Mining with Relational Database Systems: Alternatives and Implications. #@Sunita Sarawagi, Shiby Thomas, Rakesh Agrawal #t1998 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99bd4b7602d970247bdb3 #%53e9bc26b7602d9704890fdd

This data is structured in a multitude of ways. At an extreme we find data coming from traditional relational or object-oriented databases, with a completely known structure. At another extreme we have data which is fully unstructured, such as images, sounds, and raw text. But most of the data falls somewhere in between these two extremes, for a variety of reasons: the data may be structured, but the structure is not know to the user; the user may know the structure, but chooses to ignore it, for browsing purposes; the structure may be implicit, such as in formatted text, and is not as rigid and regular as in traditional databases; the data may be in non-traditional formats, such as the ASN.1 exchange format; the schema of the data is huge and changes often, so that we may prefer to ignore it. Several researchers have worked recently on problems related to data fitting this description, and have coined the term semistructured data for it. Two recent tutorials [Abi97, Bun97] contain an excellent introduction to semistructured data and a comprehensive bibliography on this new research topic."	#*Foreword: Management of Semistructured Data. #@Dan Suciu #t1997 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9a7e3b7602d9703122916

The system give users control of selecting kinds of information the client retrieves and, within limits, the frequency of those retrievals.The system is divided into client and server segments, referred to as “PointCast Client” and “the DataCenter” respectively. PointCast client is a program that runs on the user's Internet-connected computer, and performs a number of functions in addition to retrieving information from the DataCenter.The server side of the system, known as the PointCast DataCenter, supports the client by providing compelling content in a timely fashion. The Data Center is composed of multiple sites geographically distributed all over US, each carrying a number of industrial strength web servers called “PointServers”. The PointServers are highly customized and “infinitely” scalable to serve close to 200 million requests handled by the PointCast network in a day.The PointCast network receives content from over 100 different sources via satellite links or over the internet. A cluster of servers in the Data Center run customized processes round the clock which assimilate data from various sources to index, format and store it in multiple content databases.This presentation will describe the basic plumbing of the PointCast Network and how some of the challenges of establishing one of the busiest data centers in the world were addressed and implemented.

"#*Next generation database systems won't work without semantics! (panel) #@John Mylopoulos #t1998 #cSIGMOD '98 Proceedings of the 1998 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data #index539087e720f70186a0d69678 #!In the late '70s, while second generation DBMS products and technologies were entering the market, there was significant research activity whose aim was to make greater use of semantic information in database systems. The focus of that research was primarily on semantic data models and data modelling, including semantic query processing and integrity checking. However, few if any of the results of these efforts found their way in database technologies of the day, or database management practices. Instead, semantic issues were delegated to early phases of information system development (including requirements analysis and design), as well as application development.Today's database system technologies perform admirably well with semantically trivial operations and representations. At the same time, these technologies are being challenged in virtually every area of data management, with new applications which demand ways of dealing more explicitly with the meaning of the data being managed. For example, interoperation between applications requires that the underlying databases interoperate meaningfully. This currently requires a mammoth manual reverse engineering effort that simply cannot be sustained or funded by any large organization. The same applies to data warehouses, since they too require the correct semantic merging of data from semantically diverse sources. Errors in merging these sources can lead to significant problems of interpretation and potentially of the functions that the warehouse is designed to deliver. The effectiveness of database technologies to web-related information gathering and management applications is likewise limited by the degree to which they can accommodate semantics of the information being sought. Along the same lines, the emergence of organizational knowledge management as the next major application of computing in organizations clearly offers a tremendous opportunity for database technologies. But, again, this opportunity begs the question whether such technologies can succeed if they continue to ignore semantic issues.In summary, semantic issues were put aside by database technologies of the past. However, the database application challenges of the '90s seem to demand solutions to precisely such issues today. This panel intends to examine these long standing research issues on database semantics and their failures to penetrate database technologies. The discussion will also review emerging application areas and their need for mechanisms that deal with data semantics. Finally, the panelists will comment on relevant research tasks that need to be addressed in this long-ignored area of database modeling, management, access, and processing."	#*Panel on Next Generation Database Systems Won't Work Without Semantics! #@John Mylopoulos #t1998 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a7abb7602d97030e5782 #%53e9bc26b7602d9704890fdd

Having workflow templates for electronic commerce processes results in a component-based architecture where components can be agents (both buying and selling) as well as existing applications invoked by the workflows. Other advantages provided by the workflow technology are forward recovery, detailed logging of the processes through workflow history manager and being able to specify data and control flow among the workflow components.In the architecture proposed, the resources expose their metadata using Resource Description Framework (RDF) to be accessed by the resource discovery agents and their content through Extensible Markup Language (XML) to be accessed by the selling agents by using Document Object Model (DOM). The common set of Document Type Definitions (DTDs) are used to eliminate the need for an ontology.The marketplace contains an Intelligent Directory Service (IDS) which makes it possible for agents to find out about each other through a match making mechanism. References to the related Document Type Definitions (DTDs) are stored in IDS. The IDS also contains the template workflows for buying and selling processes."	#*A Workflow-based Electronic Marketplace on the Web. #@Asuman Dogac, Ilker Durusoy, Sena Nural Arpinar, Nesime Tatbul, Pinar Koksal, Ibrahim Cingil, Nazife Dimililer #t1998 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b6e8b7602d9704278b3a #%53e9afeeb7602d9703a411ba #%53e9984bb7602d970207a805 #%53e99b3cb7602d97023dd5a8 #%53e9a464b7602d9702d827da #%53e9ad12b7602d97036f3a7a

The data in these formats is not usable by standard query processing engines and hence users need a way of extracting data from these sources into a DBMS or of writing wrappers around the sources. This paper describes NoDoSE, the Northwestern Document Structure Extractor, which is an interactive tool for semi-automatically determining the structure of such documents and then extracting their data. Using a GUI, the user hierarchically decomposes the file, outlining its interesting regions and then describing their semantics. This task is expedited by a mining component that attempts to infer the grammar of the file from the information the user has input so far. Once the format of a document has been determined, its data can be extracted into a number of useful forms. This paper describes both the NoDoSE architecture, which can be used as a test bed for structure mining algorithms in general, and the mining algorithms that have been developed by the author. The prototype, which is written in Java, is described and experiences parsing a variety of documents are reported."	#*NoDoSE - A Tool for Semi-Automatically Extracting Semi-Structured Data from Text Documents. #@Brad Adelberg #t1998 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a058b7602d970293aa4d #%53e9bc26b7602d9704890fdd

In a record caching model, individual records are stored together in a section of shared memory to form the cache. Traditional relational database systems have individual pages that are stored together in shared memory to form the cache and records are then extracted from these pages on demand. The record cache model has better memory utilization than the page model and also helps reduce overheads like page fetches/writes, page locks and code path.In May 1996, Oracle Rdb announced a record breaking number of 14227 tpmC on a Digital AlphaServer 8400. At the time, this was the best TPC-C performance achieved on a single SMP machine. A total of 15 record caches, caching 19.5 million records, consuming almost 7 GB of memory, formed the bulk of the shared memory."	#*Oracle Rdb's Record Caching Model. #@Richard Anderson, Gopalan Arun, Richard Frank #t1998 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9afe8b7602d9703a39679 #%53e9bc26b7602d9704890fdd

The paper claims that this should be particularly true for the provision and access to scientific literature where the tradition so far has been mostly free access by customers and non-transparent cost accounting and service procurement by university libraries. We report on a project for developing a technical network infrastructure that allows for a more cost-transparent access to scientific literature by campus users and attempts to add a competitive element to library services. Equally important, it provides added value to the users so that they can orient themselves in the vast expanses of scientific literature much faster and more economically.

I/O capacity and associated processing requirements for DSS workloads are increasing at a rapid rate, doubling roughly every nine to twelve months [38]. In response to this increasing storage and computational demand, we present a computer architecture for decision support database servers that utilizes “intelligent” disks (IDISKs). IDISKs utilize low-cost embedded general-purpose processing, main memory, and high-speed serial communication links on each disk. IDISKs are connected to each other via these serial links and high-speed crossbar switches, overcoming the I/O bus bottleneck of conventional systems. By off-loading computation from expensive desktop processors, IDISK systems may improve cost-performance. More importantly, the IDISK architecture allows the processing of the system to scale with increasing storage demand."	#*A Case for Intelligent Disks (IDISKs). #@Kimberly Keeton, David A.

Supporting such large user populations requires many mechanisms for high concurrency and throughput. Algorithms in all areas of the server ranging from process and buffer management to SQL compilation and execution must be designed to be highly scalable. Efficient resource sharing mechanisms are required to prevent server-side resource requirements from growing unboundedly with the number of users. Parallel execution across multiple systems is necessary to allow user-population and throughput to scale beyond the restrictions of a single system. In addition to scalability, mechanisms for high availability, ease-of-use, and rich functionality are necessary for supporting complex user applications typical of realistic workloads. All mechanisms must be portable to a wide variety of installations ranging from desk-top systems to large scale enterprise servers and to a wide variety of operating systems."	#*About Quark Digital Media System. #@Kamar Aulakh #t1998 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9ab25b7602d97034afa23 #%53e9bc26b7602d9704890fdd

In this paper we present a domain-specific software architecture that delineates the abstract components of a generic market and specifies control and data-flow constraints between them, and a framework that allows convenient pluggability of components that implement specific market policies. The framework was realized in the GEM system. GEM provides infrastructure services that allow market designers to focus solely on market-issues. In addition, it allows dynamic (re)configuration of components. This functionality can be used to change market-policies as the environment or market trends change, adding another level of flexibility to market designers and administrators."	#*A Componentized Architecture for Dynamic Electronic Markets. #@Benny Reich, Israel Ben-Shaul #t1998 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b8a1b7602d970447d825 #%53e9b8a1b7602d9704479b27 #%53e9990db7602d970214b6b7 #%53e9a1fab7602d9702afa4d8 #%53e99ed1b7602d970279b2a3

Intended as a major enhancement of the current second generation SQL standard, commonly called SQL-92 because of the year it was published, SQL3 was originally planned to be issued in about 1996…but things didn't go as planned.As you may be aware, SQL3 has been characterized as “object-oriented SQL” and is the foundation for several object-relational database management systems (including Oracle's ORACLE8, Informix' Universal Server, IBM's DB2 Universal Database, and Cloudscape's Cloudscape, among others). This is widely viewed as a “good thing”, but it has had a downside, too: it took nearly 7 years to develop, instead of the planned 3 or 4.As we shall show, SQL:1999 is much more than merely SQL-92 plus object technology. It involves additional features that we consider to fall into SQL's relational heritage, as well as a total restructuring of the standards documents themselves with an eye towards more effective standards progression in the future."	#*SQL: 1999, formerly known as SQL 3. #@Andrew Eisenberg, Jim Melton #t1999 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9a480b7602d9702d9b138

The capability to conveniently search through many types of video assets from a large number of video sources with easy-to-use user profiles cannot be found anywhere yet. VideoAnywhere has developed such a capability in the form of an extensible architecture as well as a specific implementation using the latest in Internet programming (Java, agents, XML, etc.) and applicable standards. It automatically extracts and manages an extensible set of metadata of major types of videos that can be queried using either attribute-based or keyword-based search. It also provides user profiling that can be combined with the query processing for filtering. A user-friendly interface provides management of all system functions and capabilities. VideoAnywhere can also be used as a video search engine for the Web, and a servlet-based version has also been implemented."	#*VideoAnywhere: A System for Searching and Managing Distributed Video Assets. #@Amit P.

"#*First-class views: a key to user-centered computing #@Arnon Rosenthal, Edward Sciore #t1999 #cACM SIGMOD Record #index539087fe20f70186a0d758e3 #!Large database systems (e.g., federations, warehouses) are multi-layer — i.e., a combination of base databases and (virtual or physical) view databases1. Smaller systems use views for layers that hide detailed physical and conceptual structures. We argue that most databases would be more effective if they were more user-centered — i.e., if they allowed users, administrators, and application developers to work mostly within their native view. To do so, we need first class views — views that support most of the metadata and operations available on source tables.First class views could also make multi-tier object architectures (based on objects in multiple tiers of servers) easier to build and maintain. The views modularize code for data services (e.g., query, security) and for coordinating changes with neighboring tiers. When data in each tier is derived declaratively, one can generate some of these methods semi-automatically.Much of the functionality required to support first class views can be generated semi-automatically, if the derivations between layers are declarative (e.g., SQL, rather than Java). We present a framework where propagation rules can be defined, allowing the flexible and incremental specification of view semantics, even by non-programmers. Finally, we describe research areas opened up by this approach."	#*First-Class Views: A Key to User-Centered Computing. #@Arnon Rosenthal, Edward Sciore #t1999 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9a61fb7602d9702f4b489

The use of Hilbert curve values and MBR can reduce the spatial cover of an MBR.Several R-tree variants have been developed; R*-tree, S-tree, Hilbert R-tree, and R*-tree combined with the linear split method by Ang et al.

From these statistics a multi-dimensional histogram is built. Afterwards, this histrogram can be used for estimating the cost of the target method whenever this method is referenced in a query.

We define the notion of information content for each individual organizational unit of a web document as an indication of its captured information. The concept of information content is used as a foundation for defining the notion of relative information content which determines the transmission order of various units. Our mechanism allows a web client to explore the more content-bearing portion of a web document earlier so as to be able to terminate browsing a possibly irrelevant document sooner. This scheme is based on our observation that different organizational units of a document contribute to different amount of information to the document. Such a multi-resolution transmission paradigm is particularly useful in mobile web where the wireless bandwidth is a scarce resource and browsing every document in detail would consume the bandwidth unnecessarily. This is becoming more serious when the size of a web document is getting large, such as technical documents.

This information will come from diverse sources, including field monitoring, remotely sensed imagery, and environmental models. Of the three the latter has the greatest potential of providing regional and global scale information on the behavior of environmental systems, which may be vital for setting multi-governmental policy and for making decisions that are critical to quality of life. However, environmental models have limited prootocol for quality control and standardization. They tend to have weak or poorly defined semantics and so their output is often difficult to interpret outside a very limited range of applications for which they are designed. This paper considers this issue with respect to spatially distributed environmental models. A method of measuring the semantic proximity between components of large, integrated models is presented, along with an example illustrating its application. It is concluded that many of the issues associated with weak model semantics can be resolved with the addition of self-evaluating logic and context-based tools that present the semantic weaknesses to the end-user."	#*Semantic Integration of Environmental Models for Application to Global Information Systems and Decision-Making. #@D.

The goal of a query routing system is to provide efficient associative access to a large, heterogeneous, distributed collection of information providers by routing a user query to the most relevant information sources that can provide the best answer. Effective query routing not only minimizes the query response time and the overall processing cost, but also eliminates a lot of unnecessary communication overhead over the global networks and over the individual information sources.The AQR-Toolkit divides the query routing task into two cooperating processes: query refinement and source selection. It is well known that a broadly defined query inevitably produces many false positives. Query refinement provides mechanisms to help the user formulate queries that will return more useful results and that can be processed efficiently. As a complimentary process, source selection reduces false negatives by identifying and locating a set of relevant information providers from a large collection of available sources. By pruning irrelevant information sources, source selection also reduces the overhead of contacting the information servers that do not contribute to the answer of the query.The system architecture of AQR-Toolkit consists of a hierarchical network (a directed acyclic graph) with external information providers at the leaves and query routers as mediating nodes. The end-point information providers support query-based access to their documents. At a query router node, a user may browse and query the meta information about information providers registered at that query router or make use of the router's facilitates for query refinement and source selection."	#*AQR-Toolkit: An Adaptive Query Routing Middleware for Distributed Data Intensive Systems. #@Ling Liu, Calton Pu, David Buttler, Wei Han, Henrique Paques, Wei Tang #t2000 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99daab7602d97026689be #%53e9be21b7602d9704adc0bb
"#*Incremental maintenance of recursive views using relational calculus/SQL #@Guozhu Dong, Jianwen Su #t2000 #cACM SIGMOD Record #index5390880220f70186a0d77f61 #!Views are a central component of both traditional database systems and new applications such as data warehouses. Very often the desired views (e.g. the transitive closure) cannot be defined in the standard language of the underlying database system. Fortunately, it is often possible to incrementally maintain these views using the standard language. For example, transitive closure of acyclic graphs, and of undirected graphs, can be maintained in relational calculus after both single edge insertions and deletions. Many such results have been published in the theoretical database community. The purpose of this survey is to make these useful results known to the wider database research and development community.There are many interesting issues involved in the maintenance of recursive views. A maintenance algorithm may be applicable to just one view, or to a class of views specified by a view definition language such as Datalog. The maintenance algorithm can be specified in a maintenance language of different expressiveness, such as the conjunctive queries, the relational calculus or SQL. Ideally, this maintenance language should be less expensive than the view definition language. The maintenance algorithm may allow updates of different kinds, such as just single tuple insertions, just single tuple deletions, special set-based insertions and/or deletions, or combinations thereof. The view maintenance algorithms may also need to maintain auxiliary relations to help maintain the views of interest. It is of interest to know the minimal arity necessary for these auxiliary relations and whether the auxiliary relations are deterministic. While many results are known about these issues for several settings, many further challenging research problems still remain to be solved."	#*Incremental Maintenance of Recursive Views Using Relational Calculus/SQL. #@Guozhu Dong, Jianwen Su #t2000 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9aa73b7602d97033e79bb

The archives will be stored at diverse geographical locations. One of the first of these projects, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is creating a 5-wavelength catalog over 10,000 square degrees of the sky (see http://www.sdss.org/). The 200 million objects in the multi-terabyte database will have mostly numerical attributes in a 100+ dimensional space. Points in this space have highly correlated distributions.The archive will enable astronomers to explore the data interactively. Data access will be aided by multidimensional spatial and attribute indices. The data will be partitioned in many ways. Small tag objects consisting of the most popular attributes will accelerate frequent searches. Splitting the data among multiple servers will allow parallel, scalable I/O and parallel data analysis. Hashing techniques will allow efficient clustering, and pair-wise comparison algorithms that should parallelize nicely. Randomly sampled subsets will allow de-bugging otherwise large queries at the desktop. Central servers will operate a data pump to support sweep searches touching most of the data. The anticipated queries will require special operators related to angular distances and complex similarity tests of object properties, like shapes, colors, velocity vectors, or temporal behaviors.

In this survey paper we explore the problem of identifying and extracting interesting knowledge from large collections of data residing in data warehouses, by using data mining techniques. Such techniques have the ability to identify patterns and build succinct models to describe the data. These models can also be used to achieve summarization and approximation. We review the associated work in the OLAP, data mining, and approximate query answering literature. We discuss the need for the traditional data mining techniques to adapt, and accommodate the specific characteristics of OLAP systems. We also examine the notion of interestingness of data, as a tool to guide the analysis process. We describe methods that have been proposed in the literature for determining what is interesting to the user and what is not, and how these approaches can be incorporated in the data mining algorithms."	#*Knowledge Discovery in Data Warehouses. #@Themistoklis Palpanas #t2000 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b17ab7602d9703c03ddb

By \"model,\" we mean a complex structure that represents a design artifact, such as a relational schema, object-oriented interface, UML model, XML DTD, web-site schema, semantic network, complex document, or software configuration. Many uses of models involve managing changes in models and transformations of data from one model into another. These uses require an explicit representation of \"mappings\" between models. We propose to make database systems easier to use for these applications by making \"model\" and \"model mapping\" first-class objects with special operations that simplify their use. We call this capability model management.In addition to making the case for model management, our main contribution is a sketch of a proposed data model. The data model consists of formal, object-oriented structures for representing models and model mappings, and of high-level algebraic operations on those structures, such as matching, differencing, merging, selection, inversion and instantiation.

Therefore, the performance and the optimisation schemes utilised for this operator is of major importance for the performance of temporal DBMSs. Insofar, performance studies for various algorithms that implement this operator have been conducted, however, the joint optimisation of the coalesce operator with other algebraic operators that appear in the query execution plan has only received minimal attention. In this paper, we propose a scheme for combining the coalesce operator with selection operators which are applied to the valid time of the tuples produced from a coalescing operation. The proposed scheme aims at reducing the number of tuples that a coalescing operator must process, while at the same time allows the optimiser to exploit temporal indices on the valid time of the data."	#*An Optimisation Scheme for Coalesce/Valid Time Selection Operator Sequences. #@Costas Vassilakis #t2000 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9be72b7602d9704b31b40

We have already developed a theoretical framework for query optimization based on an effective calculus, called the monoid comprehension calculus [4]. The system reported here is a fully operational ODMG 2.0 [2] OODB management system, based on this framework. Our system can handle most ODL declarations and can process most OQL query forms. &lgr;-DB is not ODMG compliant. Instead it supports its own C++ binding that provides a seamless integration between OQL and C++ with low impedance mismatch. It allows C++ variables to be used in queries and results of queries to be passed back to C++ programs. Programs expressed in our C++ binding are compiled by a preprocessor that performs query optimization at compile time, rather than run-time, as it is proposed by ODMG. In addition to compiled queries, &lgr;-DB provides an interpreter that evaluates ad-hoc OQL queries at run-time. The &lgr;-DB system architecture is shown in Figure 1. The &lgr;-DB evaluation engine is written in SDL (the SHORE Data Language) of the SHORE object management system [1], developed at the University of Wisconsin. ODL schemas are translated into SDL schemas in a straightforward way and are stored in the system catalog. The &lgr;-DB OQL compiler is a C++ preprocessor that accepts a language called &lgr;-OQL, which is C++ code with embedded DML commands to perform transactions, queries, updates, etc. The preprocessor translates &lgr;-OQL programs into C++ code that contains calls to the &lgr;-DB evaluation engine. We also provide a visual query formulation interface, called VOODOO, and a translator from visual queries to OQL text, which can be sent to the &lgr;-DB OQL interpreter for evaluation.Even though a lot of effort has been made to make the implementation of our system simple enough for other database researchers to use and extend, our system is quite sophisticated since it employs current state-of-the-art query optimization technologies as well as new advanced experimental optimization techniques which we have developed through the years, such as query unnesting [3].

It has evolved from its predecessor Mentor [1], but aims at a simpler architecture. The main goal of Mentor-lite has been to build a light-weight, extensible, and tailorable workflow management system (WFMS) with small footprint and easy-to-use administration capabilities. Our approach is to provide only kernel functionality inside the workflow engine, and consider system components like history management and worklist management as extensions on top of the kernel. The key point to retain the light-weight nature is that these extensions are implemented as workflows themselves.The workflow specifications are interpreted at runtime, which is a crucial prerequisite for flexible exception handling and dynamic modifications during runtime. The interpreter performs a stepwise execution of the workflow specification according to its formal semantics. For each step, the activities to be performed by the step are determined and started.Mentor-lite supports a protocol for distributed execution of workflows spread across multiple workflow engines. This support is crucial for workflows that span large, decentralized enterprises with largely autonomous organizational units or even cross multiple enterprises to form so-called “virtual enterprises”. A communication manager is responsible for sending and receiving synchronization messages between the engines. In order to guarantee a consistent global state even in the presence of site or network failures, we have built reliable message queues using the CORBA Object Transaction Services.For administration, Mentor-lite provides a Java-based workbench for workflow design, workflow partitioning across multiple workflow servers, and a Java-based runtime monitoring tool."	#*A Goal-driven Auto-Configuration Tool for the Distributed Workflow Management System Mentor-lite. #@Michael Gillmann, Jeanine Weißenfels, German Shegalov, Wolfgang Wonner, Gerhard Weikum #t2000 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b803b7602d97043b885a #%53e9be21b7602d9704adc0bb

There have been a lot of methods proposed and developed for efficient frequent pattern mining in various kinds of databases, including transaction databases, time-series databases, etc. However, so far there is no serious performance benchmarking study of different frequent pattern mining methods.To facilitate an analytical comparison of different frequent mining methods, we have constructed an open test bed for performance study of a set of recently developed, popularly used methods for mining frequent patterns in transaction databases and mining sequential patterns in sequence databases, with different data characteristics. The testbed consists of the following components.A synthetic data generator, which can generate large sets of synthetic data in various kinds of data distributions. A few large data sets from real world applications will also be provided.A good set of typical frequent pattern mining methods, ranging from classical algorithms to recent studies. The method are grouped into three classes: frequent pattern mining, max-pattern mining, and sequential pattern mining. For frequent pattern mining, we will demonstrate Apriori, hashing, partitioning, sampling, TreeProjection, and FP-growth. For maximal pattern mining, we will demonstrate MaxMiner, TreeProjection, and FP-growth-max. For sequential pattern mining, we will demonstrate GSP and FreeSpan.A set of performance curves. These algorithms their running speeds, scalabilities, bottlenecks, and performance on different data distributions, will be compared and demonstrated upon request. Some performance curves from our pre-conference experimental evaluations will also be shown.An open testbed. Our goal is to construct an extensible test bed which integrates the above components and supports an open-ended testing service. Researchers can upload the object codes of their mining algorithms, and run them in the test bed using these data sets. The architecture is shown in Figure 1.This testbed is our first step towards benchmarking data mining algorithms. By doing so, performance of different algorithms can be reported consistently, on the same platform, and in the same environment. After the demo, we plan to make the testbed available on the WWW so that it may, hopefully, benefit further research and development of efficient data mining methods."	#*Towards Data Mining Benchmarking: A Testbed for Performance Study of Frequent Pattern Mining. #@Jian Pei, Runying Mao, Kan Hu, Hua Zhu #t2000 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b422b7602d9703f1c3a1 #%53e9be21b7602d9704adc0bb

The purpose of this workshop was to bring together leading practitioners, developers and researchers to explore the challenging technical issues and find feasible solutions for advancing the current state of the art in e-commerce and web-based information systems. In particular, the workshop was interested in the infrastructure issues to facilitate e-commerce and Web-based information systems.WECWIS 2000 was successful. There were three invited talks, one industrial panel discussion and six technical sessions. The keynote speech, \"The global trading web: A strategic vision for the Internet economy,\" was delivered by Dr. Jay M. Tenebaum, VP and Chief Scientist, Commerce One, Inc., on June 8 immediately following the opening remarks by the conference chair. The banquet address, \"Business issues in e-commerce,\" was delivered by Mr. Daniel Druker, General Manager, Hyperion e-Business Division. Finally, a lunch address, \"B2C, B2B, N2N, N2M: Why 2 is so instrumental?\" was delivered by Mr. Mstafa A. Syed, VP of Technology, VertialNet, Inc.The industrial panel was moderated by Dr. L. Mason and Dr. Z. Zhang, both of Blue Martini Software. The panelists included J. Becher, Accrue Software; L. Mellot, Business Objects; A. Srivastava, Blue Martini Software; and C. Zhou, IBM. The panel discussion topic was \"Can e-business intelligence survive?\" Among the many interesting issues being discussed were: Will privacy concerns stunt e-business intelligence utility? Will integrated e-commerce solutions be able to collect and analyze click steams, contents, products and sales data simultaneously? To what extent can out-of-the-box combined e-commerce and e-business intelligence solutions be useful? Is data mining useful in B2B e-commerce? Both positive and negative responses were hotly debated.There were a total of 30 papers included in the technical presentations, organized into six sessions. They were selected after rigorous reviews by the program committee members. The presented papers cover a wide range of topics, from framework, architecture and protocol issues of e-commerce to various types of e-services to web-based information systems for facilitating e-commerce. The rest of this report provides a brief summary of the technical presentations given in the workshop. The entire workshop proceedings is available from the IEEE Computer Society."	#*Report on Second International Workshop on Advanced Issues of E-Commerce and Web-based Information Systems. #@Kun-Lung Wu, Philip S.

The increase of multimedia data within documents sharply exacerbates the shortcomings of these approaches. Recently, research prototypes and commercial experiments have added techniques that augment similarity-based search and ranking. These techniques rely on judgments about the 'value' of documents. Judgments are obtained directly from users, are derived by conjecture based on observations of user behavior, or are surmised from analyses of documents and collections. All these systems have been pursued independently, and no common understanding of the underlying processes has been presented. We survey existing value-based approaches, develop a reference architecture that helps compare the approaches, and categorize the constituent algorithms. We explain the options for collecting value metadata, and for using that metadata to improve search, ranking of results, and the enhancement of information browsing. Based on our survey and analysis, we then point to several open problems."	#*Beyond Document Similarity: Understanding Value-Based Search and Browsing Technologies. #@Andreas Paepcke, Hector Garcia-Molina, Gerard Rodríguez-Mulà, Junghoo Cho #t2000 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e99c60b7602d9702513fb8

In IAVI, we define an absolute validity interval (AVI), for each data item based on its dynamic property such as the update interval. A mobile client can verify the validity of a cached item by comparing the last update time and its AVI. A cached item is invalidated if the current time is greater than the last update time plus its AVI. With this self-invalidation mechanism, the IAVI scheme uses the invalidation report to inform the mobile clients about changes in AVIs rather than the update event of the data items. As a result, the size of the invalidation report can be reduced significantly. Through extensive simulation experiments, we have found that the performance of the IVAI scheme is significantly better than other methods such as bit sequence and timestamp."	#*Cache Invalidation Scheme for Mobile Computing Systems with Real-time Data. #@Joe Chun-Hung Yuen, Edward Chan, Kam-yiu Lam, Hei-Wing Leung #t2000 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9a15bb7602d9702a4e028 #%53e9b740b7602d97042da0da #%53e99c58b7602d970250715a #%53e9a263b7602d9702b6c10f #%53e9a281b7602d9702b8a2e8 #%53e99960b7602d97021a1697

These complex queries often have a lot of common sub-expressions, either within a single query, or across multiple such queries run as a batch. Multiquery optimization aims at exploiting common sub-expressions to reduce evaluation cost. Multi-query optimization has hither-to been viewed as impractical, since earlier algorithms were exhaustive, and explore a doubly exponential search space.In this paper we demonstrate that multi-query optimization using heuristics is practical, and provides significant benefits. We propose three cost-based heuristic algorithms: Volcano-SH and Volcano-RU, which are based on simple modifications to the Volcano search strategy, and a greedy heuristic. Our greedy heuristic incorporates novel optimizations that improve efficiency greatly. Our algorithms are designed to be easily added to existing optimizers. We present a performance study comparing the algorithms, using workloads consisting of queries from the TPC-D benchmark.

This month's column describes some of the recent work that has taken place in TPC, the Transaction Processing Performance Council.TPC-A and TPC-B are obsolete benchmarks that you might have heard about in the past. TPC-C V3.5 is the current benchmark for OLTP systems. Introduced in 1992, it has been run on many hardware platforms and DBMS's. Indeed, the TPC web site currently lists 202 TPC-C benchmark results. Due to its maturity, TPC-C will not be discussed in this article.We've asked two very knowledgeable individuals to write this article. Meikel Poess is the chair of the TPC H and TPC-R Subcommittees and Chris Floyd is the chair of the TPC-W Subcommittee. We greatly appreciate their efforts.A wealth of information can be found at the TPC web site [ 1 ].

C. Bussler (Net-fish Technologies), M. Bichler (Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration), and Y. Hoffner and H. Ludwig (IBM Zurich Research Laboratory) organised the workshop and chaired the program committee.The objective of the workshop was to provide a platform to discuss models and technologies for service outsourcing, with emphasis on the integration of the dynamic establishment, setup, and enactment of service relationships that connect the business processes of service provider and consumer businesses, thereby establishing virtual enterprises.Nowadays, many production companies integrate their procurement processes using online marketplaces and network-based supply chain management systems. However, this is not the case for the service industry. Whereas many service organisations have already automated their internal business process management (e.g. using workflow management systems or enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems), service marketplaces still remain an uncommon phenomenon. The reason for this is that the integration of service sales, service enactment, and customer interaction with the service process still appears to be highly difficult. This is particularly the case where complex services, such as insurance and complex logistics, involve considerable customer interaction."	#*Report in ISDO '00: The CAiSE*00 Workshop on Infrastructures for Dynamic Business-to-Business Service Outsourcinga. #@Heiko Ludwig, Paul W.

However, code defects often remain undetected as the query optimizer's choice of an execution plan is not only depending on the query but strongly influenced by a large number of parameters describing the database and the hardware environment. Modifying these parameters in order to steer the optimizer to select other plans is difficult since this means anticipating often complex search strategies implemented in the optimizer.In this paper we devise algorithms for counting, exhaustive generation, and uniform sampling of plans from the complete search space. Our techniques allow extensive validation of both generation of alternatives, and execution algorithms with plans other than the optimized one—if two candidate plans fail to produce the same results, then either the optimizer considered an invalid plan, or the execution code is faulty. When the space of alternatives becomes too large for exhaustive testing, which can occur even with a handful of joins, uniform random sampling provides a mechanism for unbiased testing.The technique is implemented in Microsoft's SQL Server, where it is an integral part of the validation and testing process."	#*Counting, Enumerating, and Sampling of Execution Plans in a Cost-Based Query Optimizer. #@Florian Waas, César A.

This tutorial describes characteristics of directories such as schema information, query language and support, storage mechanisms required, typical requirements imposed by applications, etc. We then explain the differences between a directory and relational database, and show how the two are required to co-exist in a typical enterprise.An essential characteristic assumed for information stored in directories is that it is relatively static and that the queries are mostly read only. We describe typical directory applications to validate this assumption and project the requirements imposed on them as these applications evolve. We then describe areas of overlap between traditional databases and directories, describe some database and directory integration solutions adopted in the market, and identify areas in which directory deployment can benefit from the experience gathered by the database community."	#*Tutorial: LDAP Directory Services - Just Another Database Application? #@Shridhar Shukla, Anand Deshpande #t2000 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a4f3b7602d9702e15d07 #%53e9be21b7602d9704adc0bb

There are several reasons for this trend:As sites grow larger, managing the content becomes impossible without the use of a DBMS to keep track of the nature, origin, authorship, and modification history of each article.As sites become more interactive, tracking and logging user activity and user contributions creates valuable new data, which again is best managed using a DBMS. The emerging paradigm of Customer-Centric e-Business places a premium on engaging users, building a relationship with them across visits, and leveraging their expertise and feed-back. Supporting this paradigm means that we not only have to track what users visit on a site, we also have to enable them to offer opinions and contribute to the content of the website in various ways; naturally, this requires us to use a DBMS.In order to personalize a user's experience, a site must dynamically construct (or at least fine-tune) each page as it is delivered, taking into account information about the user's past activity and the nature of the content on the current page. In other words, personalization is made possible by utilizing the information (about content and user activity) that we already indicated is best managed using a DBMS.In summary, as websites go beyond a passive collection of pages to be browsed and seek to present users with a personalized, interactive experience, the role of database management systems becomes central.In this talk, I will present an overview of these issues, including a discussion of related techniques such as cookies and web server logs for tracking user activity."	#*From Browsing to Interacting: DBMS Support for Responive Websites (Abstract). #@Raghu Ramakrishnan #t2000 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a12ab7602d9702a18ed2 #%53e9be21b7602d9704adc0bb

Specifically, we address the following question. Since the primary task in data mining is the development of models about aggregated data, can we develop accurate models without access to precise information in individual data records? We consider the concrete case of building a decision-tree classifier from training data in which the values of individual records have been perturbed. The resulting data records look very different from the original records and the distribution of data values is also very different from the original distribution. While it is not possible to accurately estimate original values in individual data records, we propose a novel reconstruction procedure to accurately estimate the distribution of original data values. By using these reconstructed distributions, we are able to build classifiers whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of classifiers built with the original data."	#*Privacy-Preserving Data Mining. #@Rakesh Agrawal, Ramakrishnan Srikant #t2000 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99b36b7602d97023d6d1b #%53e9be21b7602d9704adc0bb

The model moves beyond simple information searching and browsing across multiple repositories, to inquiry of knowledge about the contents of digital libraries. To address users' high- order cognitive requests, we propose an information space consisting of a knowledge subspace and a document subspace. We extend the traditional indexing and searching schema of digital libraries from keyword-based to knowledge-based by adding knowledge to the documents into the DL information space.

This capability is useful when the events are based on a dependency model among business processes, applications and resources. The ability to express an event by employing a general dependency model, an to use it through a designated event correlation monitoring tool, enables the accomplishment of tasks such as impact analysis and business processes monitoring, including prediction of violation of constraints (such as: service level agreements).This demonstrated tool provides the system designer with the ability to define and describe events and their relationships to other events, objects and tasks. The model employs various conditional dependencies that are specific to the event domain. The demo shows how systems (business processes) are monitored using the dependency / event model, by applying rules using an event correlation engine with strong expressive power.This demo proposal describes the generic application development tool, the middleware architecture and framework and the demo."	#*Monitoring Business Processes through Event Correlation based on Dependency Model. #@Asaf Adi, David Botzer, Opher Etzion, Tali Yatzkar-Haham #t2001 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a92ab7602d970327bfd9 #%53e9b2aab7602d9703d536d8

The job of Publish/Subscribe software is to send events to the owners of subscriptions satisfied by those events. For example, a user subscription may consist of an interest in an airplane of a certain type, not to exceed a certain price. A published event may consist of an offer of an airplane with certain properties including price. Each subscription consists of a conjunction of (attribute, comparison operator, value) predicates. A subscription closely resembles a trigger in that it is a long-lived conditional query associated with an action (usually, informing the subscriber). However, it is less general than a trigger so novel data structures and implementations may enable the creation of more scalable, high performance publish/subscribe systems. This paper describes an attempt at the construction of such algorithms and its implementation. Using a combination of data structures, application-specific caching policies, and application-specific query processing our system can handle 600 events per second for a typical workload containing 6 million subscriptions."	#*Filtering Algorithms and Implementation for Very Fast Publish/Subscribe. #@Françoise Fabret, Hans-Arno Jacobsen, François Llirbat, João Pereira, Kenneth A.

This series of conferences was launched in 1994 by Troels Andreasen, Henning Christiansen and Henrik Larsen from Roskilde University in Denmark, who have been the main driving force behind this series ever since. The previous FQAS events were held in Denmark in 1994, 1996, mad 1998. The next conference in this series will return to Denmark in 2002.This conference provides an opportunity for researchers, developers and practitioners to explore new ideas and approaches in a multidisciplinary forum to the aim of providing effective solutions to the problem of easy, flexible and intuitive access to electronically stored information. The focus of this conference is to add flexibility to the systems for the storage and access to information; as there exist several classes of such systems, the conference draws on several research areas, including information retrieval, database management, knowledge representation, multimedia systems and human-computer interaction.As a paradigm for flexible query answering we may think about an expert human intermediary who is able to analyze users information needs and to evaluate the relevant information items from the available information sources. The knowledge on the information sources and the capability to interpret the user requests enable the expert to perform a good estimate of the items possibly satisfying the users needs, though the query, per se, may be imprecise, incomplete, etc. Thus, one of the key issues for defining flexible query answering system is the tolerance to imprecision and uncertainty in the formulation of user queries as well as in the representation of information.The conference brought together more than 70 researchers and developers working in the area of information technology. The conference program included five invited talks, a keynote speech and 12 technical sessions. There was a total of 55 reviewed papers included in the technical sessions.In the proceedings, the contributions are gathered according to 6 main topics, each one corresponding to one or more technical sessions.

"#*Time series similarity measures and time series indexing (abstract only) #@Dimitrios Gunopulos, Gautam Das #t2001 #cSIGMOD '01 Proceedings of the 2001 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data #index5390881220f70186a0d7e368 #!Time series is the simplest form of temporal data. A time series is a sequence of real numbers collected regularly in time, where each number represents a value. Time series data come up in a variety of domains, including stock market analysis, environmental data, telecommunications data, medical data and financial data. Web data that count the number of clicks on given cites, or model the usage of different pages are also modeled as time series. Therefore time series account for a large fraction of the data stored in commercial databases. There is recently increasing recognition of this fact, and support for time series as a different data type in commercial data bases management systems is increasing. IBM DB2 for example implements support for time series using data-blades.The pervasiveness and importance of time series data has sparked a lot of research work on the topic. While the statistics literature on time series is vast, it has not studied methods that would be appropriate for the time series similarity and indexing problems we discuss here; much of the relevant work on these problems has been done by the computer science community.One interesting problem with time series data is finding whether different time series display similar behavior. More formally, the problem can be stated as: Given two time series X and Y, determine whether they are similar or not (in other words, define and compute a distance function dist(X, Y)). Typically each time series describes the evolution of an object, for example the price of a stock, or the levels of pollution as a function of time at a given data collection station. The objective can be to cluster the different objects to similar groups, or to classify an object based on a set of known object examples. The problem is hard because the similarity model should allow for imprecise matches. One interesting variation is the subsequence similarity problem, where given two time series X and Y, we have to determine those subsequences of X that are similar to pattern Y. To answer these problems, different notions of similarity between time series have been proposed in data mining research.In the tutorial we examine the different time series similarity models that have been proposed, in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The solutions encompass techniques from a wide variety of disciplines, such as databases, signal processing, speech recognition, pattern matching, combinatorics and statistics. We survey proposed similarity techniques, including the Lp norms, time warping, longest common subsequence measures, baselines, moving averaging, or deformable Markov model templates.Another problem that comes up in applications is the indexing problem: given a time series X, and a set of time series S = {Y1,…,YN}, find the time series in S that are most similar to the query X. A variation is the subsequence indexing problem, where given a set of sequences S, and a query sequence (pattern) X, find the sequences in S that contain subsequences that are similar to X. To solve these problems efficiently, appropriate indexing techniques have to be used. Typically, the similarity problem is related to the indexing problem: simple (and possibly inaccurate) similarity measures are usually easy to build indexes for, while more sophisticated similarity measures make the indexing problem hard and interesting.We examine the indexing techniques that can be used for different models, and the dimensionality reduction techniques that have been proposed to improve indexing performance. A time series of length n can be considered as a tuple in an n-dimensional space. Indexing this space directly is inefficient because of the very high dimensionality. The main idea to improve on it is to use a dimensionality reduction technique that takes the n item long time series, and maps it to a lower dimensional space with k dimensions (hopefully, k n).We give a detailed description of the most important techniques used for dimensionality reduction. These include: the SVD decomposition, the Fourier transform (and the similar Discrete Cosine transform), the Wavelet decomposition, Multidimensional Scaling, random projection techniques, FastMap (and variants), and Linear partitioning. These techniques have specific strengths and weaknesses, making some of them better suited for specific applications and settings.Finally we consider extensions to the problem of indexing subsequences, as well as to the problem of finding similar high-dimensional sequences, such as trajectories or video frame sequences."	#*Time Series Similarity Measures and Time Series Indexing. #@Dimitrios Gunopulos, Gautam Das #t2001 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b755b7602d97042f6ecf #%53e9b2aab7602d9703d536d8

"#*XML and information retrieval: a SIGIR 2000 workshop #@David Carmel, Yoelle Maarek, Aya Soffer #t2001 #cACM SIGMOD Record #index5390881220f70186a0d7dbfb #!XML - the eXtensible Markup Language has recently emerged as a new standard for data representation and exchange on the Interact. It is believed that it will become a universal format for data exchange on the Web and that in the near future we will find vast amounts of documents in XML format on the Web. As a result, it has become crucial to address the question of how large collections of XML documents can be sorted and retrieved efficiently and effectively.To date, most work on storing, indexing, querying, and searching documents in XML has stemmed from the database community's work on semi-structured data. An alternative approach, that has received less attention to date, is to view XML documents as a collection of text documents with additional tags and relations between these tags. IR techniques have traditionally been applied to search large sets of textual data and should thus be extended to encode the structure and semantics inherent in XML documents. Integrating IR and XML search techniques will enable more sophisticated search on the structure as well as the content of these documents, while leveraging the success of IR techniques in document similarity ranking and keyword search.The SIGIR workshop on XML and information retrieval was held July 28th, in Athens Greece. The goal of the workshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in XML and IR to discuss and define the most relevant topics in the relation between these two technologies, present recent results, and propose future directions for research. The topics for discussion included:• How to extend IR technologies to search XML documents• How to integrate XML structure in IR indexing structures• How to query XML documents both on content and structure• How to introduce the semantics inherent in XML into the search process• How to adopt database indexing techniques in an IR frameworkThe opening session of the workshop consisted of a survey of search engines for XML documents. This was followed by three technical sessions: query languages, retrieval algorithms, and IR systems for XML documents. The final talk of the day, \"Searching Annotated Language Resources in XML\", by Nancy Ide was given from the perspective of potential users of XML search systems and opened many topics for discussion. The workshop was concluded with a panel discussion where the panelists outlined their vision of the future of XML search."	#*XML and Information Retrieval: a SIGIR 2000 Workshop. #@David Carmel, Yoëlle S.

However, whereas the amount of data entering a warehouse and the number of materialized views are rapidly increasing, the time window available for maintaining materialized views is shrinking. These trends necessitate efficient techniques for the maintenance of materialized views.In this paper, we show how to find an efficient plan for the maintenance of a set of materialized views, by exploiting common subexpressions between different view maintenance expressions. In particular, we show how to efficiently select (a) expressions and indices that can be effectively shared, by transient materialization; (b) additional expressions and indices for permanent materialization; and (c) the best maintenance plan — incremental or recomputation — for each view. These three decisions are highly interdependent, and the choice of one affects the choice of the others. We develop a framework that cleanly integrates the various choices in a systematic and efficient manner. Our evaluations show that many-fold improvement in view maintenance time can be achieved using our techniques. Our algorithms can also be used to efficiently select materialized views to speed up workloads containing queries and updates."	#*Materialized View Selection and Maintenance Using Multi-Query Optimization. #@Hoshi Mistry, Prasan Roy, S.

In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from the performance perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity may not even be qualitatively meaningful [6]. In this paper, we try to outline the effects of generalizing low dimensional techniques to high dimensional applications and the natural effects of sparsity on distance based applications. We outline the guidelines required in order to re-design either the distance functions or the distance-based applications in a meaningful way for high dimensional domains. We provide novel perspectives and insights on some new lines of work for broadening application definitions in order to effectively deal with the dimensionality curse."	#*Re-designing Distance Functions and Distance-Based Applications for High Dimensional Data. #@Charu C.

The proposed technique randomly samples the frequency domain using the cumulative frequency distribution and yields good estimates without any a priori knowledge of the actual underlying distribution of spatial objects. We show experimentally that the proposed sampling technique gives smaller approximation error than the Min-Skew histogram based and wavelet based approaches for both synthetic and real datasets.

Assessing the capabilities of a system, analyzing actual and potential bottlenecks, and, naturally, comparing the pros and cons of different systems architectures have become indispensable tasks as databases management systems grow in complexity and capacity. In the course of the development of XML databases the need for a benchmark framework has become more and more evident: a great many different ways to store XML data have been suggested in the past, each with its genuine advantages, disadvantages and consequences that propagate through the layers of a complex database system and need to be carefully considered. The different storage schemes render the query characteristics of the data variably different. However, no conclusive methodology for assessing these differences is available to date.In this paper, we outline desiderata for a benchmark for XML databases drawing from our own experience of developing an XML repository, involvement in the definition of the standard query language, and experience with standard benchmarks for relational databases."	#*Why And How To Benchmark XML Databases. #@Albrecht Schmidt 0002, Florian Waas, Martin L.

Persistent archives are confronted with heterogeneous data formats, helper applications, and platforms being used over the lifetime of the archive. This is not unlike the interoperability challenges, for which mediators are devised. To prevent technological obsolescence over time and across platforms, a migration approach for persistent archives is proposed based on an XML infrastructure.We extend current archival approaches that build upon standardized data formats and simple metadata mechanisms for collection management, by involving high-level conceptual models and knowledge representations as an integral part of the archive and the ingestion/migration processes. Infrastructure independence is maximized by archiving generic, executable specifications of (i) archival constraints (i.e., \"model validators\"), and (ii) archival transformations that are part of the ingestion process. The proposed architecture facilitates construction of self-validating and self-instantiating knowledge-based archives. We illustrate our overall approach and report on first experiences using a sample collection from a collaboration with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)."	#*Preservation of Digital Data with Self-Validating, Self-Instantiating Knowledge-Based Archives. #@Bertram Ludäscher, Richard Marciano, Reagan Moore #t2001 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b6abb7602d970422aac5 #%53e9b6f3b7602d9704285a21 #%53e9af68b7602d97039abdf1

Classification is an essential capability for responding to an anomaly (attack or fault), since it gives the ability to associate appropriate responses to each anomaly type. Previous work using the well known dataset from the University of New Mexico (UNM) has demonstrated the usefulness of monitoring sequences of system calls for detecting anomalies induced by processes corresponding to several Unix Programs, such as sendmail, lpr, ftp, etc. Specifically, previous work has shown that the Anomaly Count of a running process, i.e., the number of sequences spawned by the process which are not found in the corresponding dictionary of normal activity for the Program, is a valuable feature for anomaly detection. To achieve Classification, in this paper we introduce the concept of Anomaly Dictionaries, which are the sets of anomalous sequences for each type of anomaly. It is verified that Anomaly Dictionaries for the UNM's sendmail Program have very little overlap, and can be effectively used for Anomaly Classification. The sequences in the Anomalous Dictionary enable a description of Self for the Anomalies, analogous to the definition of Self for Privileged Programs given by the Normal Dictionaries. The dependence of Classification Accuracy with sequence length is also discussed. As a side result, it is also shown that a hybrid scheme, combining the proposed classification strategy with the original Anomaly Counts can lead to a substantial improvement in the overall detection rates for the sendmail dataset. The methodology proposed is rather general, and can be applied to any situation where sequences of symbols provide an effective characterization of a phenomenon."	#*Detection and Classification of Intrusions and Faults using Sequences of System Calls. #@João B.

Each of the techniques proposed in this context works by (a) creating tables for the purpose of storing XML documents (also called relational schema generation), (b) storing XML documents by shredding them into rows in the created tables, and (c) converting queries over XML documents into SQL queries over the created tables. Since relational schema generation is a physical database design issue -- dependent on factors such as the nature of the data, the query workload and availability of schemas -- there have been many techniques proposed for this purpose. Currently, each relational schema generation technique requires its own query processor to efficiently convert queries over XML documents into SQL queries over the created tables. In this paper, we present an efficient technique whereby the same query-processor can be used for all such relational schema generation techniques. This greatly simplifies the task of relational schema generation by eliminating the need to write a special-purpose query processor for each new solution to the problem. In addition, our proposed technique enables users to query seamlessly across relational data and XML documents. This provides users with unified access to both relational and XML data without them having to deal with separate databases."	#*A General Techniques for Querying XML Documents using a Relational Database System. #@Jayavel Shanmugasundaram, Eugene J.

First, we specify a general and flexible architecture for query processing in the presence of data streams. Second, we use our basic architecture as a tool to clarify alternative semantics and processing techniques for continuous queries. The architecture also captures most previous work on continuous queries and data streams, as well as related concepts such as triggers and materialized views.

Research on managing multiversion XML documents seeks to provide efficient and robust techniques for (i) storing and retrieving, (ii) exchanging, and (iii) querying such documents. In this paper, we first show that traditional version control methods, such as RCS, and SCCS, fall short from satisfying these three requirements, and discuss alternative solutions. First, we enhance RCS with a temporal page clustering policy to achieve objective (i). Then, we discuss a reference-based versioning scheme that achieves both objectives (i) and (ii) and is also effective at supporting simple queries. The topic of supporting complex queries, including temporal ones, meshes with the burgeoning interest of database researchers in XML as a database description language, and in XML query languages. In this context, the XML versioning problems are akin to those of transaction time management for databases of objects and semistructured information. Nevertheless, the need to preserve the natural ordering of XML documents frequently requires different techniques."	#*XML Document Versioning. #@Shu-Yao Chien, Vassilis J.

In such a hybrid system, images, videos, engineering drawings, etc. are stored as files on a file server while meta-data referencing/indexing such files is created and stored in a relational database to take advantage of efficient search. In this paper we describe solutions for two potentially problematic aspects of such a data management system: backup/recovery and data consistency. We present algorithms for performing backup and recovery of the DBMS data in a coordinated fashion with the files on the file servers. Our algorithms for coordinated backup and recovery have been implemented in the IBM DB2/DataLinks product [1]. We also propose an efficient solution to the problem of maintaining consistency between the content of a file and the associated meta-data stored in the DBMS from a reader's point of view without holding long duration locks on meta-data tables. In the model, an object is directly accessed and edited in-place through normal file system APIs using a reference obtained via an SQL Query on the database. To relate file modifications to meta-data updates, the user issues an update through the DBMS, and commits both file and meta-data updates together."	#*Coordinating backup/recovery and data consistency between database and file systems. #@Suparna Bhattacharya, C.

Its ability to start traversals from arbitrary context nodes in an XML document additionally enables the index to support the evaluation of path traversals embedded in XQuery expressions.

We argue that for personalization to work effectively, detailed and interoperable user profiles should be globally available for authorized sites, and these profiles should dynamically reflect the changes in user interests.Creating user profiles from user click-stream data seems to be an effective way of generating detailed and dynamic user profiles. However a user profile generated in this way is available only on the computer where the user accesses his browser, and is inaccessable when the same user works on a different computer. On the other hand, the integration of Internet with telecommunication networks have made it possible for the users to connect to Web with a variety of mobile devices as well as desk tops. This requires that user profiles should be available to any desktop or mobile device on the Internet that users choose to work with.In this paper, we address these problems through the concept of \"Trusted Authority\". A user agent at the client side that captures the user click stream, dynamically generates a navigational history 'log' file in Extensible Markup Language (XML). This log files is then used to produce the 'user profiles' in Resource Description Framework (RDF). User's right to privacy is provided through the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) standard. User profiles are uploaded to the trusted authority and served next time the user connects to the Web.The trusted authority concept, serving as a namespace qualifier, provides globally unique userid/password identification for users. Furthermore user profiles dynamically reflect the changes in their interests since the data generated while they are surfing the Web contribute to their profile. Also since the user profiles are defined in RDF, they are interoperable and available to any type of authorized device on the Internet."	#*Supporting Global User Profiles Through Trusted Authorities. #@Ibrahim Cingil #t2002 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b388b7602d9703e6a0ee #%53e9ab25b7602d97034ac9c1

Although this was only the fourth annual meeting, DOLAP has already become an important and broadly accepted forum for researchers and practitioners to share their findings in theoretical foundations, current methodologies, practical experiences, and new research directions in the areas of data warehousing and online analytical processing (OLAP). Despite the fact that conference attendance has been down since the horrific events of September 11, DOLAP 2001 attracted researchers from Europe, Asia and the Americas.The DOLAP 2001 program, which occupied a full day immediately following CIKM 2001, included a keynote talk, technical presentations, and a final discussion involving all workshop participants. As in previous years, the quality of the submitted papers was high and the program committee had a difficult time deciding which of the 31 submissions from 16 different countries should be accepted for presentation. The submitted research papers covered the state-of-the-art in data warehousing and related fields including data warehouse architecture, design and evolution, multi-dimensional modeling, query optimization, indexing, view materialization and maintenance, data warehouse quality, XML- and object-based warehouses, and data warehousing and the Web. In addition, the committee received a number of industrial submissions describing ongoing data warehousing projects and novel applications for warehouses. After careful review, 12 research and industrial papers were selected for presentation at DOLAP 2001. The proceedings are published by ACM Press, and are also available online at www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/dolap/dolap2001.html.In addition, the authors of the three highest-ranked papers have been invited to submit an updated, more detailed version to the Special Issue on Advances in Data Warehousing of the Data and Knowledge Engineering Journal to be published in early 2003."	#*Report on the ACM Fourth International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP (DOLAP 2001). #@Joachim Hammer #t2002 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e99ccab7602d970257c485

All existing proposals for querying XML (e.g., XQuery) rely on a pattern-specification language that allows path navigation and branching through the XML data graph in order to reach the desired data elements. Optimizing such queries depends crucially on the existence of concise synopsis structures that enable accurate compile-time selectivity estimates for complex path expressions over graph-structured XML data. In this paper, We introduce a novel approach to building and using statistical summaries of large XML data graphs for effective path-expression selectivity estimation. Our proposed graph-synopsis model (termed XSKETCH) exploits localized graph stability to accurately approximate (in limited space) the path and branching distribution in the data graph. To estimate the selectivities of complex path expressions over concise XSKETCH synopses, we develop an estimation framework that relies on appropriate statistical (uniformity and independence) assumptions to compensate for the lack of detailed distribution information. Given our estimation framework, we demonstrate that the problem of building an accuracy-optimal XSKETCH for a given amount of space is &#119977;&#119979;-hard, and propose an efficient heuristic algorithm based on greedy forward selection. Briefly, our algorithm constructs an XSKETCH synopsis by successive refinements of the label-split graph, the coarsest summary of the XML data graph. Our refinement operations act locally and attempt to capture important statistical correlations between data paths. Extensive experimental results with synthetic as well as real-life data sets verify the effectiveness of our approach. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to address this timely problem in the most general setting of graph-structured data and complex (branching) path expressions."	#*Statistical synopses for graph-structured XML databases. #@Neoklis Polyzotis, Minos N.

By breaking the abstraction of shared relational algebra expressions, our Telegraph CACQ implementation is able to share physical operators --- both selections and join state --- at a very fine grain. We augment these features with a grouped-filter index to simultaneously evaluate multiple selection predicates. We include measurements of the performance of our core system, along with a comparison to existing continuous query approaches."	#*Continuously adaptive continuous queries over streams. #@Samuel Madden, Mehul A.

Query rewriting, which is the first step of this process, rewrites a query expression into an equivalent form to prepare it for plan generation. COKO-KOLA introduced a new approach to query rewriting that enables query rewrites to be formally verified using an automated theorem prover [1]. KOLA is a language for expressing term rewriting rules that can be \"fired\" on query expressions. COKO is a language for expressing query rewriting transformations that are too complex to express with simple KOLA rules [2].COKO is a programming language designed for query optimizer development. Programming languages require debuggers, and in this demonstration, we illustrate our COKO debugger: Visual COKO. Visual COKO enables a query optimization developer to visually trace the execution of a COKO transformation. At every step of the transformation, the developer can view a tree-display that illustrates how the original query expression has evolved."	#*Visual COKO: a debugger for query optimizer development. #@Daniel J.

Each call to a source is a WebSource Implementation (WSI) and it is associated with both a capability and (a possibly dynamic) cost. The multiplicity of WSIs with varying costs and capabilities increases the complexity of a traditional optimizer that must assign WSIs for each remote relation in the query while generating an (optimal) plan. We present a two-phase Web Query Optimizer (WQO). In a pre-optimization phase, the WQO selects one or more WSIs for a pre-plan; a pre-plan represents a space of query evaluation plans (plans) based on this choice of WSIs. The WQO uses cost-based heuristics to evaluate the choice of WSI assignment in the pre-plan and to choose a good pre-plan. The WQO uses the pre-plan to drive the extended relational optimizer to obtain the best plan for a pre-plan. A prototype of the WQO has been developed. We compare the effectiveness of the WQO, i.e., its ability to efficiently search a large space of plans and obtain a low cost plan, in comparison to a traditional optimizer. We also validate the cost-based heuristics by experimental evaluation of queries in the noisy Internet environment."	#*Efficient evaluation of queries in a mediator for WebSources. #@Vladimir Zadorozhny, Louiqa Raschid, Maria-Esther Vidal, Tolga Urhan, Laura Bright #t2002 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9acf0b7602d97036d0dd2 #%53e9b3e9b7602d9703edad8e #%53e9ab1ab7602d97034a1fae #%53e9a178b7602d9702a66d66 #%53e99b63b7602d97024058ae #%53e9b137b7602d9703bbbbdd #%53e9abf1b7602d97035ace6a #%53e9bb43b7602d970477f997 #%53e9b44bb7602d9703f44f90 #%53e9b413b7602d9703f0b9b9 #%53e999cab7602d970220f707 #%53e99d3eb7602d97025f5b71 #%53e9b029b7602d9703a87220 #%53e9b80fb7602d97043c0431 #%53e99acab7602d970234928b #%53e9b3ceb7602d9703ebb6ef #%53e9b976b7602d9704562633 #%53e9a7c8b7602d9703109317

At the time, we referred to the work that had been done as \"infrastructure\". We are pleased to be able to say that significant progress has been made, and SQL/XML [2] is now going out for the first formal stage of processing, Final Committee Draft (FCD) ballot, in ISO/IEC JTC1.In our previous column, we described the mapping of SQL 〈identifier〉s to XML Names, SQL data types to XML Schema data types, and SQL values to XML values. There have been a few small corrections and enhancements in these areas, but for the most part the descriptions in our previous column are still accurate.Thc new work that we will discuss in this column comes in three parts. The first part provides a mapping from a single table, all tables in a schema, or all tables in a catalog to an XML document. The second of these parts includes the creation of an XML data type in SQL and adds functions that create values of this new type. These functions allow a user to produce XML from existing SQL data. Finally, the \"infrastructure\" work that we described in our previous article included the mapping of SQL's predefined data types to XML Schema data types. This mapping has been extended to include the mapping of domains, distinct types, row types, arrays, and multisets.The FCD ballot that we mentioned began in early April. This will allow the comments contained in the ballot responses to be discussed at the Editing Meeting in September or October of this year. We expect the Editing Meeting to recommend progression to Final Draft International Status (FDIS) ballot, which suggests that an International Standard will be published by the middle of 2003."	#*SQL/XML is Making Good Progress. #@Andrew Eisenberg, Jim Melton #t2002 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9ae04b7602d9703810ef7

The project objective was to provide layered network and application services for transporting XML-based business transaction flows across multi-tier, heterogeneous data processing environments. This paper documents the business scenario, the eHub application, and the network transport mechanisms that were used to build the n-tier hub. Contrary to most eHubs, this solution takes the point of view of suppliers, pushing data in accordance with supplier requirements; hence, enhancing the probability of supplier adoption.

In practice however XML documents are often generated dynamically, by some program: checking whether all XML documents generated by the program are valid w.r.t. a given type is called the typechecking problem. While a validation analyzes an XML document, a type checker analyzes a program, and the problem's difficulty is a function of the language in which that program is expressed. The XML typechecking problem has been investigated recently in [MSV00, HP00, HVP00, AMN+01a, AMN+01b] and the XQuery Working Group adopted some of these techniques for typechecking XQuery [FFM+01]).

The importance of this problem derives from the fact that, once extracted, the data can be handled in a way similar to instances of a traditional database. The approaches proposed in the literature to address the problem of Web data extraction use techniques borrowed from areas such as natural language processing, languages and grammars, machine learning, information retrieval, databases, and ontologies. As a consequence, they present very distinct features and capabilities which make a direct comparison difficult to be done. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy for characterizing Web data extraction fools, briefly survey major Web data extraction tools described in the literature, and provide a qualitative analysis of them.

Monitoring requirements range from the long term (e.g., monitoring link utilizations, computing traffic matrices) to the ad-hoc (e.g. detecting network intrusions, debugging performance problems). Many of the applications are complex (e.g., reconstruct TCP/IP sessions), query layer-7 data (find streaming media connections), operate over huge volumes of data (Gigabit and higher speed links), and have real-time reporting requirements (e.g., to raise performance or intrusion alerts).We have found that existing network monitoring technologies have severe limitations. One option is to use TCPdump to monitor a network port and a user-level application program to process the data. While this approach is very flexible, it is not fast enough to handle gigabit speeds on inexpensive equipment. Another approach is to use network monitoring devices. While these devices are capable of high speed monitoring, they are inflexible as the set of monitoring tasks is pre-defined. Adding new functionality is expensive and has long lead times. A similar approach is to use monitoring tools built into routers, such as SNMP, RMON, or NetFlow. These tools have similar characteristics --- fast but inflexible.A further problem with all of these tools is their lack of a query interface. The data from the monitors are dumped to a file or piped through a file stream without an association to the semantics of the data. The burden of managing and interpreting the data is left to the analyst. Due to the volume and complexity of the data, the burden can be severe. These problems make developing new applications needlessly slow and difficult. Also, many mistakes are made leading to incorrect analyses."	#*Gigascope: high performance network monitoring with an SQL interface. #@Charles D.

Traditionally, optimizers use statistics built over base tables and assume independence between attributes while propagating statistical information through the query plan. This approach can introduce large estimation errors, which may result in the optimizer choosing inefficient execution plans. In this paper, we show how to extend a generic optimizer so that it also exploits statistics built on expressions corresponding to intermediate nodes of query plans. We show that in some cases, the quality of the resulting plans is significantly better than when only base-table statistics are available. Unfortunately, even moderately-sized schemas may have too many relevant candidate statistics. We introduce a workload-driven technique to identify a small subset of statistics that can provide significant benefits over just maintaining base-table statistics. Finally, we present experimental results on an implementation of our approach in Microsoft SQL Server 2000."	#*Exploiting statistics on query expressions for optimization. #@Nicolas Bruno, Surajit Chaudhuri #t2002 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b30ab7602d9703dd20e6 #%53e9b3e9b7602d9703edad8e #%53e9b6eeb7602d97042836b1 #%53e9aeddb7602d970390804a #%53e9ae17b7602d97038278be #%53e9afbab7602d9703a0a1aa #%53e99967b7602d97021a75ab #%53e9ba69b7602d9704687880 #%53e99d9db7602d9702657890 #%53e9bb53b7602d9704793bc1

One such example is a sensor network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes that combine physical sensing capabilities such as temperature, light, or seismic sensors with networking and computation capabilities [1]. Applications range from environmental control, warehouse inventory, health care to military environments. Existing sensor networks assume that the sensors are preprogrammed and send data to a central frontend where the data is aggregated and stored for offfsline querying and analysis. This approach has two major draw-backs. First, the user cannot change the behavior of the system on the fly. Second, communication in today's networks is orders of magnitude more expensive than local computation, thus in-network processing can vastly reduce resource usage and thus extend the lifetime of a sensor network.This demo demonstrates a database approach to unite the seemingly conflicting requirements of scalability and flexibility in monitoring the physical world. We demonstrate the COUGAR System, a new distributed data management infrastructure that scales with the growth of sensor interconnectivity and computational power on the sensors over the next decades. Our system resides directly on the sensor nodes and creates the abstraction of a single processing node without centralizing data or computation."	#*COUGAR: the network is the database. #@Wai Fu Fung, David Sun, Johannes Gehrke #t2002 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e999eeb7602d9702231c4b #%53e9b3e9b7602d9703edad8e #%53e9b414b7602d9703f0c493

While this approach has been and continues to be successful, the advent of the Internet and the need to execute queries over streaming sources requires a different approach, since for streaming inputs the cardinality may not be known or may not even be knowable (as is the case for an unbounded stream.) In view of this, we propose shifting from a cardinality-based approach to a rate-based approach, and give an optimization framework that aims at maximizing the output rate of query evaluation plans. This approach can be applied to cases where the cardinality-based approach cannot be used. It may also be useful for cases where cardinalities are known, because by focusing on rates we are able not only to optimize the time at which the last result tuple appears, but also to optimize for the number of answers computed at any specified time after the query evaluation commences. We present a preliminary validation of our rate-based optimization framework on a prototype XML query engine, though it is generic enough to be used in other database contexts. The results show that rate-based optimization is feasible and can indeed yield correct decisions."	#*Rate-based query optimization for streaming information sources. #@Stratis Viglas, Jeffrey F.

Hence, XML is likely to be the format through which data from multiple sources is integrated.In this paper we study the problem of integrating XML data sources through correlations realized as join operations. A challenging aspect of this operation is the XML document structure. Two documents might convey approximately or exactly the same information but may be quite different in structure. Consequently approximate match in structure, in addition to, content has to be folded in the join operation. We quantify approximate match in structure and content using well defined notions of distance. For structure, we propose computationally inexpensive lower and upper bounds for the tree edit distance metric between two trees. We then show how the tree edit distance, and other metrics that quantify distance between trees, can be incorporated in a join framework. We introduce the notion of reference sets to facilitate this operation. Intuitively, a reference set consists of data elements used to project the data space. We characterize what constitutes a good choice of a reference set and we propose sampling based algorithms to identify them. This gives rise to a variety of algorithmic approaches for the problem, which we formulate and analyze. We demonstrate the practical utility of our solutions using large collections of real and synthetic XML data sets."	#*Approximate XML joins. #@Sudipto Guha, H. V.

The use of SIMD instructions has two immediate performance benefits: It allows a degree of parallelism, so that many operands can be processed at once. It also often leads to the elimination of conditional branch instructions, reducing branch mispredictions.We consider the most important database operations, including sequential scans, aggregation, index operations, and joins. We present techniques for implementing these using SIMD instructions. We show that there are significant benefits in redesigning traditional query processing algorithms so that they can make better use of SIMD technology. Our study shows that using a SIMD parallelism of four, the CPU time for the new algorithms is from 10% to more than four times less than for the traditional algorithms. Superlinear speedups are obtained as a result of the elimination of branch misprediction effects."	#*Implementing database operations using SIMD instructions. #@Jingren Zhou, Kenneth A.

Successful examples of commercially viable software services include rent-a-spreadsheet, electronic mail services, general storage services, disaster protection services. \"Database as a Service\" model provides users power to create, store, modify, and retrieve data from anywhere in the world, as long as they have access to the Internet. It introduces several challenges, an important issue being data privacy. It is in this context that we specifically address the issue of data privacy.There are two main privacy issues. First, the owner of the data needs to be assured that the data stored on the service-provider site is protected against data thefts from outsiders. Second, data needs to be protected even from the service providers, if the providers themselves cannot be trusted. In this paper, we focus on the second challenge. Specifically, we explore techniques to execute SQL queries over encrypted data. Our strategy is to process as much of the query as possible at the service providers' site, without having to decrypt the data. Decryption and the remainder of the query processing are performed at the client site. The paper explores an algebraic framework to split the query to minimize the computation at the client site. Results of experiments validating our approach are also presented."	#*Executing SQL over encrypted data in the database-service-provider model. #@Hakan Hacigümüs, Balakrishna R.

Such a level of interoperability involves being able to find potential business partners, discovering their services and business processes, and conducting business \"on the fly\". This process of dynamic interoperation is only possible through standard B2B frameworks. Indeed a number of B2B electronic commerce standard frameworks have emerged recently. Although most of these standards are overlapping and competing, each with its own strenghts and weeknesses, a closer investigation reveals that they can be used in a manner to complement one another.In this paper we describe such an implementation where an ebXML infrastructure is developed by exploiting the Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) registries and RosettaNet Partner Interface Processes (PIPs). ebXML is an ambitious effort and produced detailed specifications of an infrastructure both for B2B and B2C e-commerce. However a public ebXML compliant registry/repository mechanism is not available yet. On the other hand, UDDI's approach to developing a registry has been a lot simpler and public registries are available. In ebXML, trading parties collaborate by agreeing on the same business process with complementary roles. Therefore there is a need for standardized business processes. In this respect, exploiting the already developed expertise through RosettaNet PIPs becomes indispensable. We show how to create and use ebXML \"Binary Collaborations\" based on RosettaNet PIPs and provide a GUI tool to allow users to graphically build their ebXML business processes by combining RosettaNet PIPs. In ebXML, trading parties reveal essential information about themselves through Collaboration Protocol Profiles (CPPs). To conduct business, an agreement between parties is necessary and this is expressed"	#*An ebXML infrastructure implementation through UDDI registries and RosettaNet PIPs. #@Asuman Dogac, Yusuf Tambag, Pinar Pembecioglu, Sait Pektas, Gokce Laleci, Gokhan Kurt, Serkan Toprak, Yildiray Kabak #t2002 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9be2eb7602d9704ae82bd #%53e9b3e9b7602d9703edad8e

We argue that this strict model is too rigid for exploratory queries over diverse and distributed data sources, such as sources on the Internet. Instead, we propose a looser model of querying in which a user submits a broad initial query outline, and the system continually generates partial result tuples that may contain values for only some of the output fields. The user can watch these partial results accumulate at the user interface, and accordingly refine the query by specifying their interest in different kinds of partial results.After describing our querying model and user interface, we present a query processing architecture for this model which is implemented in the Telegraph dataflow system. Our architecture is designed to generate partial results quickly, and to adapt query execution to changing user interests. The crux of this architecture is a dataflow operator that supports two kinds of reorderings: reordering of intermediate tuples within a dataflow, and reordering of query plan operators through which tuples flow. We study reordering policies that optimize for the quality of partial results delivered over time, and experimentally demonstrate the benefits of our architecture in this context."	#*Partial results for online query processing. #@Vijayshankar Raman, Joseph M.

As we discuss below, this information can be used to build concise, yet accurate, statistical summaries for XML data. StatiX leverages standard XML technology for gathering statistics, notably XML Schema validators, and it uses histograms to summarize both the structure and values in an XML document. In this paper we describe the StatiX system. We develop algorithms that decompose schemas to obtain statistics at different granularities and discuss how statistics can be gathered as documents are validated. We also present an experimental evaluation which demonstrates the accuracy and scalability of our approach and show an application of these statistics to cost-based XML storage design."	#*StatiX: making XML count. #@Juliana Freire, Jayant R.

An important scenario is that the incoming stream is a continually appended time series, and the patterns are time series in a database. At each time when a new value arrives (called a time position), the system needs to find, from the database, the nearest or near neighbors of the incoming time series up to the time position. This paper attacks the problem by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to efficiently find the cross correlations of time series, which yields, in a batch mode, the nearest and near neighbors of the incoming time series at many time positions. To take advantage of this batch processing in achieving fast response time, this paper uses prediction methods to predict future values. FFT is used to compute the cross correlations of the predicted series (with the values that have already arrived) and the database patterns, and to obtain predicted distances between the incoming time series at many future time positions and the database patterns. When the actual data value arrives, the prediction error together with the predicted distances is used to filter out patterns that are not possible to be the nearest or near neighbors, which provides fast responses. Experiments show that with reasonable prediction errors, the performance gain is significant."	#*Continually evaluating similarity-based pattern queries on a streaming time series. #@Like Gao, Xiaoyang Sean Wang #t2002 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99fddb7602d97028b9693 #%53e9b3e9b7602d9703edad8e #%53e9b145b7602d9703bc86e8 #%53e9b4e0b7602d9704006b0c #%53e99d28b7602d97025ddb21 #%53e9a263b7602d9702b690a2 #%53e9b4eeb7602d97040178c0 #%53e9b179b7602d9703c00991 #%53e9ac7bb7602d97036524b7 #%53e99cb5b7602d9702568b3f #%53e99b56b7602d97023fcbdd #%53e99f42b7602d9702810ff0 #%53e9b7cdb7602d9704377823 #%53e9ab1ab7602d97034a2a24 #%53e9b290b7602d9703d348f2 #%53e9ad4fb7602d9703735b9b #%53e99fefb7602d97028cc813 #%53e9ab7eb7602d9703523d7a #%53e9ace9b7602d97036c86a0 #%53e9ab89b7602d970353276d #%53e9ae04b7602d970380f064 #%53e9b234b7602d9703cd35f6 #%53e9bc27b7602d970489332c

A major criticism of such techniques is that unlike, for example, random sampling, conventional wavelet synopses do not provide informative error guarantees on the accuracy of individual approximate answers. In fact, as this paper demonstrates, errors can vary widely (without bound) and unpredictably, even for identical queries on nearly-identical values in distinct parts of the data. This lack of error guarantees severely limits the practicality of traditional wavelets as an approximate query-processing tool, because users have no idea of the quality of any particular approximate answer. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic Wavelet Synopses, the first wavelet-based data reduction technique with guarantees on the accuracy of individual approximate answers. Whereas earlier approaches rely on deterministic thresholding for selecting a set of \"good\" wavelet coefficients, our technique is based on a novel, probabilistic thresholding scheme that assigns each coefficient a probability of being retained based on its importance to the reconstruction of individual data values, and then flips coins to select the synopsis. We show how our scheme avoids the above pitfalls of deterministic thresholding, providing highly-accurate answers for individual data values in a data vector. We propose several novel optimization algorithms for tuning our probabilistic thresholding scheme to minimize desired error metrics. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic data sets evaluate these algorithms, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our probabilistic wavelet synopses in providing fast, highly-accurate answers with error guarantees."	#*Wavelet synopses with error guarantees. #@Minos N.

The query aspects of a QFR are captured by its query set specification, which formally encodes multiple parameterized condition fragments and can describe large numbers of queries. The run-time component of QURSED produces XQuery-compliant queries by synthesizing fragments from the query set specification that have been activated during the interaction of the end-user with the QFR. The design-time component of QURSED, called QURSED Editor, semi-automates the development of the query set specification and its association with the visual components of the QFR by translating visual actions into appropriate query set specifications. We describe QURSED and illustrate how it accommodates the intricacies that the semistructured nature of the underlying database introduces. We specifically focus on the formal model of the query set specification, its generation via the QURSED Editor and its coupling with the visual aspects of the web-based form and report."	#*QURSED: querying and reporting semistructured data. #@Yannis Papakonstantinou, Michalis Petropoulos, Vasilis Vassalos #t2002 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b3f6b7602d9703ee8540 #%53e9b3e9b7602d9703edad8e #%53e9afc0b7602d9703a11420 #%53e9abb9b7602d970356847d #%53e9b63bb7602d97041988c6 #%53e9ab6fb7602d9703511a24 #%53e9afeeb7602d9703a429c6 #%53e9b3efb7602d9703edf1d9 #%53e9a79eb7602d97030dd9f6 #%53e9bd6ab7602d9704a084e8 #%53e9a636b7602d9702f65fce #%53e9a7c1b7602d970310225c #%53e99ac4b7602d970234037a #%53e99afdb7602d9702389b9d #%53e99bfeb7602d97024a7868 #%53e9bc05b7602d9704864804

This paper approaches the problem from a different angle. A solution is sought in an unconventional storage scheme, that opens up a new range of techniques for processing k-NN queries, especially suited for high dimensional spaces. The suggested (physical) database design accommodates well a novel variant of branch-and-bound search, that reduces the high dimensional space quickly to a small candidate set. The paper provides insight in applying this idea to k-NN search using two similarity metrics commonly encountered in image database applications, and discusses techniques for its implementation in relational database systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated empirically on both real and synthetic data sets, reporting the significant improvements in response time yielded."	#*Efficient k-NN search on vertically decomposed data. #@Arjen P. de Vries, Nikos Mamoulis, Niels Nes, Martin L.

Although definitions of similarity vary from one clustering model to another, in most of these models the concept of similarity is based on distances, e.g., Euclidean distance or cosine distance. In other words, similar objects are required to have close values on at least a set of dimensions. In this paper, we explore a more general type of similarity. Under the pCluster model we proposed, two objects are similar if they exhibit a coherent pattern on a subset of dimensions. For instance, in DNA microarray analysis, the expression levels of two genes may rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of environmental stimuli. Although the magnitude of their expression levels may not be close, the patterns they exhibit can be very much alike. Discovery of such clusters of genes is essential in revealing significant connections in gene regulatory networks. E-commerce applications, such as collaborative filtering, can also benefit from the new model, which captures not only the closeness of values of certain leading indicators but also the closeness of (purchasing, browsing, etc.) patterns exhibited by the customers. Our paper introduces an effective algorithm to detect such clusters, and we perform tests on several real and synthetic data sets to show its effectiveness."	#*Clustering by pattern similarity in large data sets. #@Haixun Wang, Wei Wang 0010, Jiong Yang, Philip S.

Finding all occurrences of such a twig pattern in an XML database is a core operation for XML query processing. Prior work has typically decomposed the twig pattern into binary structural (parent-child and ancestor-descendant) relationships, and twig matching is achieved by: (i) using structural join algorithms to match the binary relationships against the XML database, and (ii) stitching together these basic matches. A limitation of this approach for matching twig patterns is that intermediate result sizes can get large, even when the input and output sizes are more manageable.In this paper, we propose a novel holistic twig join algorithm, TwigStack, for matching an XML query twig pattern. Our technique uses a chain of linked stacks to compactly represent partial results to root-to-leaf query paths, which are then composed to obtain matches for the twig pattern. When the twig pattern uses only ancestor-descendant relationships between elements, TwigStack is I/O and CPU optimal among all sequential algorithms that read the entire input: it is linear in the sum of sizes of the input lists and the final result list, but independent of the sizes of intermediate results. We then show how to use (a modification of) B-trees, along with TwigStack, to match query twig patterns in sub-linear time. Finally, we complement our analysis with experimental results on a range of real and synthetic data, and query twig patterns."	#*Holistic twig joins: optimal XML pattern matching. #@Nicolas Bruno, Nick Koudas, Divesh Srivastava #t2002 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a813b7602d970315a659 #%53e9b3e9b7602d9703edad8e #%53e9b57cb7602d97040be00a #%53e9be57b7602d9704b1a06c #%53e99afdb7602d970238ac7a #%53e9b137b7602d9703bbcc97 #%53e9a0dfb7602d97029cc607 #%53e9a645b7602d9702f76308 #%53e9bc31b7602d970489fcdc #%53e9be80b7602d9704b43a6c

Such systems are inexpensive, easy to use, highly scalable and do not require central administration. Despite their advantages, however, limited work has been done on employing database systems on top of P2P networks.Here we propose the PeerOLAP architecture for supporting On-Line Analytical Processing queries. A large number low-end clients, each containing a cache with the most useful results, are connected through an arbitrary P2P network. If a query cannot be answered locally (i.e. by using the cache contents of the computer where it is issued), it is propagated through the network until a peer that has cached the answer is found.

This is creating a new set of data management requirements involving XML, such as the need to store and query XML documents. Researchers have proposed using relational database systems to satisfy these requirements by devising ways to \"shred\" XML documents into relations, and translate XML queries into SQL queries over these relations. However, a key issue with such an approach, which has largely been ignored in the research literature, is how (and whether) the ordered XML data model can be efficiently supported by the unordered relational data model. This paper shows that XML's ordered data model can indeed be efficiently supported by a relational database system. This is accomplished by encoding order as a data value. We propose three order encoding methods that can be used to represent XML order in the relational data model, and also propose algorithms for translating ordered XPath expressions into SQL using these encoding methods. Finally, we report the results of an experimental study that investigates the performance of the proposed order encoding methods on a workload of ordered XML queries and updates."	#*Storing and querying ordered XML using a relational database system. #@Igor Tatarinov, Stratis Viglas, Kevin S.

The framework allows us to integrate large amounts of new data into the warehouse and generate historical summaries efficiently. Query and update costs are virtually independent from the extent of the data set in the time dimension, making our framework an attractive aggregation approach for append-only data streams.

Therefore we propose to apply the ideas of semantic caching to XML query processing systems [2], in particular the XQuery engine. Semantic caching [3] implies view-based query answering and cache management. While it is well studied in the traditional database context, query containment for XQuery is left unexplored due to its complexity coming with the powerful expressiveness of hierarchy, recursion and result construction. We hence have developed the first solution for XQuery processing using cached views.We exploit the connections between XML and tree automata, and use subtype relations between two regular expression types to tackle the XQuery containment mapping problem. Inspired by XDuce [1], which explores the use of tree-automata-based regular expression types for XML processing, we have designed a containment mapping process to incorporate type inference and subtyping mechanisms provided by XDuce to establish containment mappings between regular-expression-type-based pattern variables of two queries. We have implemented a semantic caching system called XCache (see Figure 1), to realize the proposed containment and rewriting techniques for XQuery.The main modules of XCache include: (1) Query Decomposer. An input query is is decomposed into source-specific subqueries explicitly represented by matching patterns and return structures. (2) Query Pattern Register. By registering a few queries into semantic regions, we warm up XCache at its initialization phase. (3) Query Containment Mapper. The XDuce subtyper is incorporated into the containment mapper for establishing query containment mappings between variables of a new query and each cached query. (4) Query Rewriter. We implement the classical bucket algorithm and further apply heuristics to decide on an \"optimal\" rewriting plan if several valid ones exist. (5) Replacement Manager. We free space for new regions by both complete and partial replacement. (6) Region Coalescer. We apply a coalescing strategy to control the region granularity over time."	#*XCache: a semantic caching system for XML queries. #@Li Chen, Elke A.

Previous attempts use heuristic rules to make those decisions. These approaches fail to consider all of the interdependent aspects of query performance typically modeled by today's sophisticated query optimizers.We present a comprehensive solution to the problem that has been tightly integrated with the optimizer of a commercial shared-nothing parallel database system. Our approach uses the query optimizer itself both to recommend candidate partitions for each table that will benefit each query in the workload, and to evaluate various combinations of these candidates.

The ebXML framework provides such a specification schema called BPSS (Business Process Specification Schema) which is available in two stand-alone representations: a UML version, and an XML version. The former, however, is not intended for the direct creation of business process specifications, but for defining specification elements and their relationships required for creating an ebXML-compliant business process specification. For this reason, it is very important to support conceptual modeling that is well organized and directly matched with major modeling concepts. This paper deals with how to represent and manage B2B business processes using UML-compliant diagrams. The major challenge is to organize UML diagrams in a natural way that is well suited with the business process meta-model and then to transform the diagrams into an XML version.

In such cases, it may be desirable to store the data in a reduced format in order to improve the storage, transfer time, and processing requirements on the data. One of the challenges of designing effective data compression techniques is to be able to preserve the ability to use the reduced format directly for a wide range of database and data mining applications. In this paper, we propose the novel idea of hierarchical subspace sampling in order to create a reduced representation of the data. The method is naturally able to estimate the local implicit dimensionalities of each point very effectively, and thereby create a variable dimensionality reduced representation of the data. Such a technique has the advantage that it is very adaptive about adjusting its representation depending upon the behavior of the immediate locality of a data point. An interesting property of the subspace sampling technique is that unlike all other data reduction techniques, the overall efficiency of compression improves with increasing database size. This is a highly desirable property for any data reduction system since the problem itself is motivated by the large size of data sets. Because of its sampling approach, the procedure is extremely fast and scales linearly both with data set size and dimensionality.

By this generalization, we can explain earlier subsequence matching methods as special cases of a common framework. Based on the generalization, we propose a new subsequence matching method, General Match. The earlier work by Faloutsos et al. (called FRM for convenience) causes a lot of false alarms due to lack of point-filtering effect. Dual Match, recently proposed as a dual approach of FRM, improves performance significantly over FRM by exploiting point filtering effect. However, it has the problem of having a smaller allowable window size---half that of FRM---given the minimum query length. A smaller window increases false alarms due to window size effect. General Match offers advantages of both methods: it can reduce window size effect by using large windows like FRM and, at the same time, can exploit point-filtering effect like Dual Match. General Match divides data sequences into generalized sliding windows (J-sliding windows) and the query sequence into generalized disjoint windows (J-disjoint windows). We formally prove that General Match is correct, i.e., it incurs no false dismissal. We then propose a method of estimating the optimal value of the sliding factor J that minimizes the number of page accesses. Experimental results for real stock data show that, for low selectivities (10-6∼10-4), General Match improves average performance by 117% over Dual Match and by 998% over FRM; for high selectivities (10-3∼10-1), by 45% over Dual Match and by 64% over FRM. The proposed generalization provides an excellent theoretical basis for understanding the underlying mechanisms of subsequence matching."	#*General match: a subsequence matching method in time-series databases based on generalized windows. #@Yang-Sae Moon, Kyu-Young Whang, Wook-Shin Han #t2002 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9bc0ab7602d970486e1e4 #%53e9b3e9b7602d9703edad8e #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e9b557b7602d970408fc74 #%53e9b145b7602d9703bc86e8 #%53e9981db7602d970203bf5a #%53e9b4e0b7602d9704006b0c #%53e9a263b7602d9702b690a2 #%53e99f42b7602d9702810ff0 #%53e99f2eb7602d97027fbff4 #%53e9b036b7602d9703a937cf #%53e9b260b7602d9703d01a49 #%53e99fefb7602d97028cc813 #%53e9a952b7602d97032a4366 #%53e99fd6b7602d97028b0194

LEO introduces a feedback loop to query optimization that enhances the available information on the database where the most queries have occurred, allowing the optimizer to actually learn from its past mistakes. We demonstrate how LEO learns outdated table access statistics on a TPC-H like database schema and show that LEO improves the estimates for table cardinalities as well as filter factors for single predicates. Thus LEO enables the query optimizer to choose a better query execution plan, resulting in more efficient query processing. We not only demonstrate learning by repetitive execution of a single query, but also illustrate how similar, but not identical queries benefit from learned knowledge. In addition, we show the effect of both learning cardinalities and adjusting related statistics."	#*Learning table access cardinalities with LEO. #@Volker Markl, Guy M.

For example, in a protein sequence, the amino acid N is likely to mutate to D with little impact to the biological function of the protein. It would be desirable if the occurrence of D in the observation can be related to a possible mutation from N in an appropriate manner. Unfortunately, the support measure (i.e., the number of occurrences) of a pattern does not serve this purpose. In this paper, we introduce the concept of compatibility matrix as the means to provide a probabilistic connection from the observation to the underlying true value. A new metric match is also proposed to capture the \"real support\" of a pattern which would be expected if a noise-free environment is assumed. In addition, in the context we address, a pattern could be very long. The standard pruning technique developed for the market basket problem may not work efficiently. As a result, a novel algorithm that combines statistical sampling and a new technique (namely border collapsing) is devised to discover long patterns in a minimal number of scans of the sequence database with sufficiently high confidence. Empirical results demonstrate the robustness of the match model (with respect to the noise) and the efficiency of the probabilistic algorithm."	#*Mining long sequential patterns in a noisy environment. #@Jiong Yang, Wei Wang 0010, Philip S.

Existing methods for spatial selectivity estimation do not accurately estimate the selectivity of a query to moving objects, because they do not consider the future locations of moving objects, which change continuously as time passes.In this paper, we propose an effective method for spatio-temporal selectivity estimation to solve this problem. We present analytical formulas which accurately calculate the selectivity of a spatio-temporal query as a function of spatio-temporal information. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method accurately estimates the selectivity over various queries to spatio-temporal data combining real-life spatial data and synthetic temporal data. When Tiger/lines is used as real-life spatial data, the application of an existing method for spatial selectivity estimation to the estimation of the selectivity of a query to moving objects has the average error ratio from 14% to 85%, whereas our method for spatio-temporal selectivity estimation has the average error ratio from 9% to 23%."	#*Selectivity estimation for spatio-temporal queries to moving objects. #@Yong-Jin Choi, Chin-Wan Chung #t2002 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b275b7602d9703d1738f #%53e9b3e9b7602d9703edad8e #%53e9af46b7602d9703981ffd #%53e9b281b7602d9703d27829 #%53e9b607b7602d970415bd12 #%53e9ae48b7602d970385cf97

While data mining tools greatly enhance the ability of the analyst to make data-driven discoveries, most of the time spent in performing an analysis is spent in data identification, gathering, cleaning and processing the data. Similarly, schema mapping tools have been developed to help automate the task of using legacy or federated data sources for a new purpose, but assume that the structure of the data sources is well understood. However the data sets to be federated may come from dozens of databases containing thousands of tables and tens of thousands of fields, with little reliable documentation about primary keys or foreign keys.We are developing a system, Bellman, which performs data mining on the structure of the database. In this paper, we present techniques for quickly identifying which fields have similar values, identifying join paths, estimating join directions and sizes, and identifying structures in the database. The results of the database structure mining allow the analyst to make sense of the database content. This information can be used to e.g., prepare data for data mining, find foreign key joins for schema mapping, or identify steps to be taken to prevent the database from collapsing under the weight of its complexity."	#*Mining database structure; or, how to build a data quality browser. #@Tamraparni Dasu, Theodore Johnson, S.

I was loathe to speak for academics worldwide, or even just those in SIGMOD. But I then realized that I could speak from personal experience. So these random musings will be of necessity entirely subjective, highly individualistic, and unrepresentative---attributes that a scholar normally attempts to vigorously avoid in his writing. I'm definitely not a \"typical\" academic (I don't know such an animal), but I can speak with some authority as to what motivates me.As another caveat, I make few comparisons with alternatives such as working in a research lab or as a developer. I won't even attempt to speak for them.The final caveat (distrust all commentaries that start with caveats, but perhaps more so those that don't!) is that my assumed audience comprises students who are considering such a profession. Current academics will find some of my observations trite or may disagree loudly, as academics are oft to do (see below).That said, I have been an academic for exactly twenty years, and I deeply love the academic life. While I have consulted for and written papers with those away from the ivory tower, my professional life has been entirely as a professor. I went forthwith from undergraduate school to graduate school, then directly to the University of North Carolina, then to the University of Arizona, where I am happily ensconced.I open with some disadvantages to this seemingly ideal life, then turn to the advantages. With each I start with those that I expected when I was a doctoral student, and then consider those I (naïvely or otherwise) was not aware of from that early vantage point."	#*Why I Like Working in Academia. #@Richard T.

Although the algorithm rapidly gives a good estimate for many join-aggregate problem instances, the convergence can be slow if the number of tuples that satisfy the join predicate is small or if there are many groups in the output. Furthermore, if memory overflows (for example, because the user allows the algorithm to run to completion for an exact answer), the algorithm degenerates to block ripple join and performance suffers. In this paper, we build on the work of Haas and Hellerstein and propose a new algorithm that (a) combines parallelism with sampling to speed convergence, and (b) maintains good performance in the presence of memory overflow. Results from a prototype implementation in a parallel DBMS show that its rate of convergence scales with the number of processors, and that when allowed to run to completion, even in the presence of memory overflow, it is competitive with the traditional parallel hybrid hash join algorithm."	#*A scalable hash ripple join algorithm. #@Gang Luo, Curt J.

Providing (perhaps approximate) answers to queries over such continuous data streams is a crucial requirement for many application environments; examples include large telecom and IP network installations where performance data from different parts of the network needs to be continuously collected and analyzed.In this paper, we consider the problem of approximately answering general aggregate SQL queries over continuous data streams with limited memory. Our method relies on randomizing techniques that compute small \"sketch\" summaries of the streams that can then be used to provide approximate answers to aggregate queries with provable guarantees on the approximation error. We also demonstrate how existing statistical information on the base data (e.g., histograms) can be used in the proposed framework to improve the quality of the approximation provided by our algorithms. The key idea is to intelligently partition the domain of the underlying attribute(s) and, thus, decompose the sketching problem in a way that provably tightens our guarantees. Results of our experimental study with real-life as well as synthetic data streams indicate that sketches provide significantly more accurate answers compared to histograms for aggregate queries. This is especially true when our domain partitioning methods are employed to further boast the accuracy of the final estimates."	#*Processing complex aggregate queries over data streams. #@Alin Dobra, Minos N.

The dynamic nature of these applications necessitates generating web pages on-demand, making middle-tier database caching an effective approach to achieve high scalability and performance [3]. In the DBCache project, we are incorporating a database cache feature in DB2 UDB by modifying the engine code and leveraging existing federated database functionality. This allows us to take advantage of DB2's sophisticated distributed query processing power for database caching. As a result, the user queries can be executed at either the local database cache or the remote backend server, or more importantly, the query can be partitioned and then distributed to both databases for cost optimum execution.DBCache also includes a cache initialization component that takes a backend database schema and SQL queries in the workload, and generates a middle-tier database schema for the cache. We have implemented an initial prototype of the system that supports table level caching.

At the same time, hard disks with large capacity are available at affordable prices. Most of us nowadays often dump a large number of various types of documents into our computers without much thinking. On the other hand, file systems have not changed too much during the past decades. Most of them organize files in directories that form a tree structure, and a file is identified by its name and pathname in the directory tree. Remembering name of files created sometime ago and digging them out from a disk with dozen gigabytes of data in hundred thousands of files becomes never an easy task. Tools available for helping such a search are still far from satisfactory.Xbase (XML-based document BASE) is a prototype system aiming at addressing the above problem. By XML-based, we meant that XML is used to define the metadata. The current version of XBase stores text-based files, including semi-structured data such as XML, HTML, plain text documents (e.g., tex files, computer programs) and those files that can be converted into text (e.g., postscript files, PDF files). In XBase, file name is optional. Users can just load a file into XBase without giving a name and the directory where it should be stored. XBase will automatically associate it with attributes such as the time when the file was saved, its source, its size and type, and etc., To retrieve those files, XBase provides three access methods, explorative browsing, querying using query languages, and keyword based search."	#*XBase: making your gigabyte disk queriable. #@Hongjun Lu, Guoren Wang, Ge Yu, Yubin Bao, Jianhua Lv, Yaxin Yu #t2002 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b145b7602d9703bcaa1e #%53e9b3e9b7602d9703edad8e

The experiments are designed to study the collisions of fundamental particles, called \"events\", each of which is represented as a point in a multi-dimensional universe. In these environments, the best retrieval performance can be achieved only if the data is clustered on the tertiary storage by all searchable attributes of the events. Since the number of these attributes is high, the underlying data-management facility must be able to cope with extremely large volumes and very high dimensionalities of data at the same time. The proposed indexing technique is designed to facilitate both clustering and efficient retrieval of high-dimensional data on tertiary storage. The structure uses an original space-partitioning scheme, which has numerous advantages over other space-partitioning techniques. While the main objective of the design is to support high-energy physics experiments, the proposed solution is appropriate for many other scientific applications."	#*The Design of a Retrieval Technique for High-Dimensional Data on Tertiary Storage. #@Ratko Orlandic, Jack Lukaszuk, Craig Swietlik #t2002 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b159b7602d9703bdd9b3 #%53e9bc87b7602d9704906011 #%53e9aabdb7602d970343d54f #%53e9b260b7602d9703d01a49 #%53e9b108b7602d9703b87088 #%53e9a074b7602d970295e95e #%53e9a682b7602d9702fb62d1 #%53e9b72db7602d97042c5d59 #%53e9bc9eb7602d9704920d11 #%53e9a682b7602d9702fb3e67

This paper presents a tool that largely automates the task of configuring a distributed WFMS. Based on a suite of mathematical models, the tool derives the necessary degrees of replication for the various server types in order to meet specified goals for performance and availability as well as \"performability\" when service is degraded due to outages of individual servers. The paper describes the configuration tool, with emphasis on how to capture the load behavior of workflows in a realistic manner. We also present extensive experiments that evaluate the accuracy of the tool's underlying models and demonstrate the practical feasibility of automating the task of configuring a distributed WFMS. The experiments use a detailed simulation which in turn has been validated through measurements with the Mentor-lite prototype system."	#*Workflow management with service quality guarantees. #@Michael Gillmann, Gerhard Weikum, Wolfgang Wonner #t2002 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9ac33b7602d97035fcb94 #%53e9b3e9b7602d9703edad8e #%53e9a3abb7602d9702cbd675 #%53e9ae84b7602d97038a3055 #%53e9afa6b7602d97039f356f #%53e9a326b7602d9702c322a4 #%53e99b78b7602d970241e252 #%53e9aa09b7602d970337634a #%53e9be3cb7602d9704afab14 #%53e998fdb7602d970213ca84

Recently, researchers have proposed new types of B+-Trees optimized for CPU cache performance in main memory environments, where the tree node sizes are one or a few cache lines. Unfortunately, due primarily to this large discrepancy in optimal node sizes, existing disk-optimized B+-Trees suffer from poor cache performance while cache-optimized B+-Trees exhibit poor disk performance. In this paper, we propose fractal prefetching B+-Trees (fpB+-Trees), which embed \"cache-optimized\" trees within \"disk-optimized\" trees, in order to optimize both cache and I/O performance. We design and evaluate two approaches to breaking disk pages into cache-optimized nodes: disk-first and cache-first. These approaches are somewhat biased in favor of maximizing disk and cache performance, respectively, as demonstrated by our results. Both implementations of fpB+-Trees achieve dramatically better cache performance than disk-optimized B+-Trees: a factor of 1.1-1.8 improvement for search, up to a factor of 4.2 improvement for range scans, and up to a 20-fold improvement for updates, all without significant degradation of I/O performance. In addition, fpB+-Trees accelerate I/O performance for range scans by using jump-pointer arrays to prefetch leaf pages, thereby achieving a speed-up of 2.5-5 on IBM's DB2 Universal Database."	#*Fractal prefetching B±Trees: optimizing both cache and disk performance. #@Shimin Chen, Phillip B.

One such example is a sensor network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes that combine physical sensing capabilities such as temperature, light, or seismic sensors with networking and computation capabilities. Applications range from environmental control, warehouse inventory, and health care to military environments. Existing sensor networks assume that the sensors are preprogrammed and send data to a central frontend where the data is aggregated and stored for offline querying and analysis. This approach has two major drawbacks. First, the user cannot change the behavior of the system on the fly. Second, conservation of battery power is a major design factor, but a central system cannot make use of in-network programming, which trades costly communication for cheap local computation.In this paper, we introduce the Cougar approach to tasking sensor networks through declarative queries. Given a user query, a query optimizer generates an efficient query plan for in-network query processing, which can vastly reduce resource usage and thus extend the lifetime of a sensor network. In addition, since queries are asked in a declarative language, the user is shielded from the physical characteristics of the network. We give a short overview of sensor networks, propose a natural architecture for a data management system for sensor networks, and describe open research problems in this area."	#*The Cougar Approach to In-Network Query Processing in Sensor Networks. #@Yong Yao, Johannes Gehrke #t2002 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9ba6ab7602d970468d255 #%53e9ab78b7602d970351d73e #%53e9b3e9b7602d9703ed4c37 #%53e9aed1b7602d97038f99be #%53e9af6eb7602d97039b23d1 #%53e9bb15b7602d9704751494 #%53e99d87b7602d9702643b75 #%53e997f1b7602d9701feeb52 #%53e9b145b7602d9703bc8e5e #%53e99c30b7602d97024e018e #%53e9b857b7602d970441b72a #%53e9b61bb7602d9704175973 #%53e9b414b7602d9703f0c493 #%53e998f0b7602d970212bbad #%53e9a07ab7602d9702964f0c #%53e9b34ab7602d9703e23a05 #%53e9b10fb7602d9703b8c48f #%53e9bbc2b7602d970480bd4c #%53e9b068b7602d9703acec3e #%53e9b46fb7602d9703f6fc8e #%53e9ab20b7602d97034a8895 #%53e9aed7b7602d9703900c2b #%53e9ab89b7602d970353276d #%53e9a49cb7602d9702dbb71f #%53e99acab7602d970234954a

Semantic Associations capture complex relationships between entities involving sequences of predicates, and sets of predicate sequences that interact in complex ways. Detecting such associations is at the heart of many research and analytical activities that are crucial to applications in national security and business intelligence. This in combination with the improving ability to identify entities in documents as part of automatic semantic annotation, gives a very powerful capability for semantic analysis of large amounts of heterogeneous content.The approach for supporting Semantic Associations discussed in this paper has four main facets. First, it generalizes these associations into three main classes based on their structural properties, allowing us to reason about them in a domain-independent manner. The second is the provision of an operator ρ for expressing queries about such associations. Third, it uses a graph data model for knowledge representation, allowing the semantic associations search techniques to be built upon the graph algorithms for paths, while integrating knowledge from the schema into the search process. The fourth facet is the use of a notion of context, which allows for restricting the search space and for context-driven ranking of results. Just as a Web search engine looks for relevant documents in the current Web, ρ can be seen as discovering and ranking complex relationships in the Semantic Web.In this paper, we demonstrate the need for supporting such complex semantic relationships. We also give a formal basis to the notion of Semantic Associations and give a brief discussion on our overall approach for discovering and ranking them."	#*The p Operator: Discovering and Ranking Associations on the Semantic Web. #@Kemafor Anyanwu, Amit P.

We examine the performance gains to be made by compression outside the index. A novel compression algorithm is reported, which enables the processing of queries without decompressing data needed to perform join operations in a database built on a triple store. The results of modelling the performance of the database with and without compression are given and compared with other recent work in this area. It is found that for some applications, gains in performance of over 50% are achievable, and in OLTP-like situations, there are also gains to be made."	#*Performing Jobs without Decompression in a Compressed Database System. #@S.

People are eager for mobile information systems with more functionality and powerful querying facilities. In this paper, a graphical query language called MoSQL is proposed to be the basis of general mobile information systems.

Objective parameters are those related to a particular service and are measurable and verifiable. Subjective parameters are those based on the opinions of the end-users. We believe that quality of service should become an integral part of multimedia database systems and users should be able to query by requiring a quality of service from the system. The specification and enforcement of QoS presents an interesting challenge in multimedia systems development. A deal of effort has been done on QoS specification and control at the system and the network levels, but less work has been done at the application/user level. In this paper, we propose a language, in the style of constraint database languages, for formal specification of QoS constraints. The satisfaction by the system of the user quality requirements can be viewed as a constraint satisfaction problem. We believe this paper represents a first step towards the development of a database framework for quality of service management in video databases. The contribution of this paper lies in providing a logical framework for specifying and enforcing quality of service in video databases. To our knowledge, this work is the first from a database perspective on quality of service management."	#*A Database Approach to Quality of Service Specification in Video Databases. #@Elisa Bertino, Ahmed K.

To address this problem, we propose a mapping mechanism that 1) introduces a single mapping table, with each row holding one key value from the primary B+-tree, as an intermediate structure between the primary B+-tree and the associated auxiliary structures, and 2) augments the primary B+-tree structure to include in each row the physical address of the corresponding mapping table row. The mapping table row addresses can then be used in the auxiliary structures to indirectly refer to the primary B+-tree rows. The two key benefits are: 1) the mapping table shields the auxiliary structures from the volatility of the primary B+-tree row addresses, and 2) the method allows reuse of existing conventional table mechanisms for supporting auxiliary structures on primary B+- trees.This paper presents the mapping mechanism, its possible application in supporting various auxiliary structures on primary B+-trees, and a case study describing its use for supporting bitmap indexes on index-organized tables in Oracle9i. The case study demonstrates that the proposed mapping mechanism allows us to reuse existing bitmap index technologies with minimal changes. It also includes a comparison between bitmap and non-bitmap (B+- tree) index performance on index-organized tables for both single-table queries and star queries. The analytical and experimental studies show that the method is storage efficient, and (despite the mapping table overhead) provides performance benefits that are similar to those provided by bitmap indexes implemented on conventional tables."	#*A mapping mechanism to support bitmap index and other auxiliary structures on tables stored as primary B+-trees. #@Eugene Inseok Chong, Jagannathan Srinivasan, Souripriya Das, Chuck Freiwald, Aravind Yalamanchi, Mahesh Jagannath, Anh-Tuan Tran, Ramkumar Krishnan, Richard Jiang #t2003 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9bb72b7602d97047b3502 #%53e9bb72b7602d97047b70c0 #%53e9ba0bb7602d970460b494 #%53e9a877b7602d97031c253d #%53e9ad34b7602d97037197df #%53e99a2bb7602d97022870b8 #%53e99952b7602d970218f9d9 #%53e9bb72b7602d97047b70c0 #%53e9ba0bb7602d970460b494 #%53e9a877b7602d97031c253d #%53e9ad34b7602d97037197df #%53e99a2bb7602d97022870b8 #%53e99952b7602d970218f9d9

One reason for this is that XML is inherently hierarchical and SQL is supposedly not. This paper demonstrates how ANSI SQL along with its relational Cartesian product model can naturally perform complete and flexible hierarchical query processing. With this ANSI SQL inherent hierarchical processing capability, native XML data can be fully and seamlessly integrated into SQL processing and operated on at a full hierarchical level. This paper will describe the basic stages involved in this hierarchical SQL processing: hierarchical data modeling, hierarchical working set creation, and hierarchical Cartesian product processing. These processes enable a complete relational, XML, and legacy data integration which maintains ANSI SQL compatibility even while performing the most complex multi-leg hierarchical processing, and includes the dynamic, direct, and controlled hierarchical joining of hierarchical structures. Also covered are ANSI SQL hierarchical support features: hierarchical SQL views, hierarchical data filtering, and hierarchical optimization. These make standard SQL a well rounded and complete hierarchical processor. With this full hierarchical level of processing established, it will be shown how the relational Cartesian product engine can be seamlessly replaced with a hierarchical engine, greatly increasing processing and memory utilization, and enabling advanced XML hierarchical data capabilities."	#*ANSI SQL Hierarchical Processing Can Fully Integrate Native XML. #@Michael M.

The installation graph explains recoverable system state in terms of which operations are considered installed. This explanation and the set of operations replayed during recovery form an invariant that is the contract between normal operation and recovery. It prescribes how to coordinate changes to system components such as the state, the log, and the cache.

A large amount of work has been reported on XML storage models and query processing techniques. However, few works have addressed issues of XML query optimization. In this paper, we report our study on one of the challenges in XML query optimization: containment join size estimation. Containment join is well accepted as an important operation in XML query processing. Estimating the size of its results is no doubt essential to generate efficient XML query processing plans. We propose two models, the interval model and the position model, and a set of estimation methods based on these two models. Comprehensive performance studies were conducted. The results not only demonstrate the advantages of our new algorithms over existing algorithms, but also provide valuable insights into the tradeoff among various parameters."	#*Containment Join Size Estimation: Models and Methods. #@Wei Wang 0011, Haifeng Jiang, Hongjun Lu, Jeffrey Xu Yu #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b677b7602d97041e0615 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e9afacb7602d97039f7d2f #%53e9abb1b7602d970355bf0d #%53e9a533b7602d9702e58b57 #%53e9bc1bb7602d9704885f8f #%53e9a29db7602d9702ba4e51 #%53e9a1c9b7602d9702ac060d #%53e9bbd4b7602d9704821919 #%53e99fc9b7602d97028a38ae #%53e99b16b7602d97023a7500 #%53e9ae84b7602d97038a4c11 #%53e9bac9b7602d97046f992c #%53e9b4c3b7602d9703fe0d57 #%53e999d2b7602d97022180fe #%53e9b326b7602d9703df6eca #%53e9a58bb7602d9702eb23b4 #%53e99af7b7602d9702384dad #%53e9b7e7b7602d970439533c #%53e9baadb7602d97046d866e #%53e9ade2b7602d97037ef089 #%53e9be80b7602d9704b43a6c

The authors showed that a quotient cube can be constructed very efficiently and it leads to a significant reduction in the cube size. While it is an interesting proposal, that paper leaves many issues unaddressed. Firstly, a direct representation of a quotient cube is not as compact as possible and thus still wastes space. Secondly, while a quotient cube can in principle be used for answering queries, no specific algorithms were given in the paper. Thirdly, maintaining any summary structure incrementally against updates is an important task, a topic not addressed there. In this paper, we propose an efficient data structure called QC-tree and an efficient algorithm for directly constructing it from a base table, solving the first problem. We give efficient algorithms that address the remaining questions. We report results from an extensive performance study that illustrate the space and time savings achieved by our algorithms over previous ones (wherever they exist)."	#*QC-Trees: An Efficient Summary Structure for Semantic OLAP. #@Laks V.

No musical training is needed. Previous query by humming systems have not provided satisfactory results for various reasons. Some systems have low retrieval precision because they rely on melodic contour information from the hum tune, which in turn relies on the error-prone note segmentation process. Some systems yield better precision when matching the melody directly from audio, but they are slow because of their extensive use of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Our approach improves both the retrieval precision and speed compared to previous approaches. We treat music as a time series and exploit and improve well-developed techniques from time series databases to index the music for fast similarity queries. We improve on existing DTW indexes technique by introducing the concept of envelope transforms, which gives a general guideline for extending existing dimensionality reduction methods to DTW indexes. The net result is high scalability. We confirm our claims through extensive experiments."	#*Warping Indexes with Envelope Transforms for Query by Humming. #@Yunyue Zhu, Dennis Shasha #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a906b7602d97032560dc #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e9b145b7602d9703bc86e8 #%53e9a5afb7602d9702edbc0a #%53e9b4e0b7602d9704006b0c #%53e9a1e2b7602d9702ae1fb5 #%53e9aa73b7602d97033e8273 #%53e9a058b7602d970293b7fc #%53e9b14cb7602d9703bd1cc9 #%53e9aad1b7602d970344e738 #%53e9bb8cb7602d97047d50ee #%53e9b179b7602d9703c00991 #%53e9b532b7602d970406754a #%53e9bc0ab7602d970486e1e4 #%53e9a886b7602d97031d5e6c #%53e99f42b7602d9702810ff0 #%53e99f2eb7602d97027fbff4 #%53e998f6b7602d9702136b34 #%53e99c19b7602d97024c3b5c #%53e9b716b7602d97042afc74 #%53e9bd31b7602d97049bc391 #%53e9a774b7602d97030aaff8 #%53e9a0d2b7602d97029bc4f3 #%53e99fd6b7602d97028b0194 #%53e9997eb7602d97021bdae8 #%53e9bb22b7602d970475b243

This paper provides a formal, high-level operational semantics for a complex-value OQL-like query language that can create fresh database objects, and invoke external methods. We define a type system for our query language and prove an important soundness property.We define a simple effect typing discipline to delimit the computational effects within our queries.

Traditionally, the problem of matching multiple schemas has essentially relied on finding pairwise-attribute correspondence. This paper proposes a different approach, motivated by integrating large numbers of data sources on the Internet. On this \"deep Web,\" we observe two distinguishing characteristics that offer a new view for considering schema matching: First, as the Web scales, there are ample sources that provide structured information in the same domains (e.g., books and automobiles). Second, while sources proliferate, their aggregate schema vocabulary tends to converge at a relatively small size. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new paradigm, statistical schema matching: Unlike traditional approaches using pairwise-attribute correspondence, we take a holistic approach to match all input schemas by finding an underlying generative schema model. We propose a general statistical framework MGS for such hidden model discovery, which consists of hypothesis modeling, generation, and selection. Further, we specialize the general framework to develop Algorithm MGSsd, targeting at synonym discovery, a canonical problem of schema matching, by designing and discovering a model that specifically captures synonym attributes. We demonstrate our approach over hundreds of real Web sources in four domains and the results show good accuracy."	#*Statistical Schema Matching across Web Query Interfaces. #@Bin He, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99940b7602d970217f0f4 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e9b8cdb7602d97044b1a7c #%53e99fc9b7602d97028a0c0b #%53e9a9beb7602d970331c113 #%53e9bdfdb7602d9704aad059 #%53e9a609b7602d9702f35f7e

The manifestations of data quality problems can be very expensive- \"losing\" customers, \"misplacing\" billions of dollars worth of equipment, misallocated resources due to glitched forecasts, and so on. Solving data quality problems typically requires a very large investment of time and energy -- often 80% to 90% of a data analysis project is spent in making the data reliable enough that the results can be trusted.In this tutorial, we present a multi disciplinary approach to data quality problems. We start by discussing the meaning of data quality and the sources of data quality problems. We show how these problems can be addressed by a multidisciplinary approach, combining techniques from management science, statistics, database research, and metadata management. Next, we present an updated definition of data quality metrics, and illustrate their application with a case study. We conclude with a survey of recent database research that is relevant to data quality problems, and suggest directions for future research."	#*Data Quality and Data Cleaning: An Overview. #@Theodore Johnson, Tamraparni Dasu #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9bbc2b7602d9704811883 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628

We formally define a template, and propose a model that describes how values are encoded into pages using a template.

While each of these approaches is valuable in many cases, they are not infallible, and there exist instances of the schema matching problem for which they do not even apply. Such problem instances typically arise when the column names in the schemas and the data in the columns are \"opaque\" or very difficult to interpret. In this paper we propose a two-step technique that works even in the presence of opaque column names and data values. In the first step, we measure the pair-wise attribute correlations in the tables to be matched and construct a dependency graph using mutual information as a measure of the dependency between attributes. In the second stage, we find matching node pairs in the dependency graphs by running a graph matching algorithm. We validate our approach with an experimental study, the results of which suggest that such an approach can be a useful addition to a set of (semi) automatic schema matching techniques."	#*On Schema Matching with Opaque Column Names and Data Values. #@Jaewoo Kang, Jeffrey F.

Our data mining applications require past history of the sensor data. Therefore, unlike most present systems that focus on streaming data, and cache a small window of historic data, we store the entire historic data. Several interesting problems arise in these scenarios. We study two of them: (a) Given that a sensor can send data corresponding to its current configuration at any particular instant, how do we define the data that should be stored in the database? (b) Sensors try to minimize the amount of data transmitted. Also there could be data loss in the network. So the data stored will have lots of \"holes\". In this case, how can an application make sense of the stored data? In this paper, we describe our approach to solve these problems that enables an application to recreate the environment that generated the data as precisely as possible."	#*Understanding the semantics of sensor data. #@Murali Mani #t2003 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b87fb7602d97044516f7 #%53e9a7f1b7602d9703132dca #%53e9aa57b7602d97033c7c24 #%53e9ba6ab7602d970468d255 #%53e9a12ab7602d9702a1b922 #%53e9ab1ab7602d97034a2a24 #%53e9b3b2b7602d9703e99a91 #%53e9ab89b7602d970353276d #%53e9b275b7602d9703d1adbc

There is a diversity of approaches and strategies for evaluating XQuery expressions, in many cases only dealing with limited subsets of the language. In this paper we describe an implementation approach that handles XQuery with arbitrarily-nested FLWR expressions, element constructors and built-in functions (including structural comparisons). Our proposal maps an XQuery expression to a single equivalent SQL query using a novel dynamic interval encoding of a collection of XML documents as relations, augmented with information tied to the query evaluation environment. The dynamic interval technique enables (suitably enhanced) relational engines to produce predictably good query plans that do not preclude the use of sort-merge join query operators. The benefits are realized despite the challenges presented by intermediate results that create arbitrary documents and the need to preserve document order as prescribed by semantics of XQuery. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that (native or relational) XML systems can benefit from the above technique to avoid a quadratic scale up penalty that effectively prevents the evaluation of nested FLWR expressions for large documents."	#*A Comprehensive XQuery to SQL Translation using Dynamic Interval Encoding. #@David DeHaan, David Toman, Mariano P.

Structural summaries are derived directly from the data and serve as indices for evaluating path expressions on semi-structured or XML data. We introduce the D(k) index, an adaptive structural summary for general graph structured documents. Building on previous work, 1-index and A(k) index, the D(k)-index is also based on the concept of bisimilarity. However, as a generalization of the 1-index and A(k)-index, the D(k) index possesses the adaptive ability to adjust its structure according to the current query load. This dynamism also facilitates efficient update algorithms, which are crucial to practical applications of structural indices, but have not been adequately addressed in previous index proposals. Our experiments show that the D(k) index is a more effective structural summary than previous static ones, as a result of its query load sensitivity. In addition, update operations on the D(k) index can be performed more efficiently than on its predecessors."	#*D(k)-Index: An Adaptive Structural Summary for Graph-Structured Data. #@Chen Qun, Andrew Lim, Kian Win Ong #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b1c3b7602d9703c53a60 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e99ae7b7602d97023705fd #%53e9ab25b7602d97034ae5a9 #%53e9a93eb7602d970329096a #%53e99fc9b7602d97028a38ae #%53e9ab6fb7602d9703510c05 #%53e9a58bb7602d9702eb23b4 #%53e9a02db7602d9702914e87 #%53e9bc31b7602d970489fcdc #%53e99931b7602d970216cabb

Many applications, e.g., OLAP and data warehousing, process a table or tables in a database using a multi-dimensional access paradigm. Currently, most database systems can only support organization of a table using a primary clustering index. Secondary indexes are created to access the tables when the primary key index is not applicable. Unfortunately, secondary indexes perform many random I/O accesses against the table for a simple operation such as a range query. Our work in multi-dimensional clustering addresses this important deficiency in database systems. Multi-Dimensional Clustering is based on the definition of one or more orthogonal clustering attributes (or expressions) of a table. The table is organized physically by associating records with similar values for the dimension attributes in a cluster. We describe novel techniques for maintaining this physical layout efficiently and methods of processing database operations that provide significant performance improvements. We show results from experiments using a star-schema database to validate our claims of performance with minimal overhead."	#*Multi-Dimensional Clustering: A New Data Layout Scheme in DB2. #@Sriram Padmanabhan, Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee, Timothy Malkemus, Leslie Cranston, Matthew Huras #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a37ab7602d9702c878a1 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e9adf6b7602d970380169f #%53e9bb72b7602d97047b70c0

Depending on the search space and the enumeration algorithm, optimizers vary in their compilation time and the quality of the execution plan they can generate. This paper describes a compilation time estimator that provides a quantified estimate of the optimizer compilation time for a given query. Such an estimator is useful for automatically choosing the right level of optimization in commercial database systems. In addition, compilation time estimates can be quite helpful for mid-query reoptimization, for monitoring the progress of workload analysis tools where a large number queries need to be compiled (but not executed), and for judicious design and tuning of an optimizer.Previous attempts to estimate optimizer compilation complexity used the number of possible binary joins as the metric and overlooked the fact that each join often translates into a different number of join plans because of the presence of \"physical\" properties. We use the number of plans (instead of joins) to estimate query compilation time, and employ two novel ideas: (1) reusing an optimizer's join enumerator to obtain actual number of joins, but bypassing plan generation to save estimation overhead; (2) maintaining a small number of \"interesting\" properties to facilitate plan counting. We prototyped our approach in a commercial database system and our experimental results show that we can achieve good compilation time estimates (less than 30% error, on average) for complex real queries, using a small fraction (within 3%) of the actual compilation time."	#*Estimating Compilation Time of a Query Optimizer. #@Ihab F.

A data grid (datagrid) is a logical name space consisting of storage resources and digital entities that is created by the cooperation of autonomous organizations and its users based on the coordination of local and global policies. Data Grid Management Systems (DGMSs) provide services for the confluence of organizations and management of inter-organizational data and resources in the datagrid.The objective of the tutorial is to provide an introduction to the opportunities and challenges of this emerging technology. Novices and experts would benefit from this tutorial. The tutorial would cover introduction, use cases, design philosophies, architecture, research issues, existing technologies and demonstrations. Hands on sessions for the participants to use and feel the existing technologies could be provided based on the availability of internet connections."	#*Data Grid Management Systems. #@Arun Jagatheesan, Arcot Rajasekar #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99a2bb7602d97022880bb #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628

The Δ-tree is a multi-level structure where each level represents the data space at different dimensionalities: the number of dimensions increases towards the leaf level which contains the data at their full dimensions. The remaining dimensions are obtained using Principal Component Analysis, which has the desirable property that the first few dimensions capture most of the information in the dataset. Each level of the tree serves to prune the search space more efficiently as the reduced dimensions can better exploit the small cache line size. Moreover, the distance computation on lower dimensionality is less expensive. We also propose an extension, called Δ+-tree, that globally clusters the data space and then further partitions clusters into small regions to reduce the search space. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed structures against existing techniques on different kinds of datasets. Our results show that the Δ+-tree is superior in most cases."	#*Contorting High Dimensional Data for Efficient Main Memory Processing. #@Bin Cui, Beng Chin Ooi, Jianwen Su, Kian-Lee Tan #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9bd0bb7602d9704993115 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628

This information can at times be off by several orders of magnitude due to human error in configuration setup, sudden changes in load, or hardware failure. In this paper, we attempt to answer the following questions:• Are inaccurate access cost estimates likely to cause a typical query optimizer to choose a suboptimal query plan?• If an optimizer chooses a suboptimal plan as a result of inaccurate access cost estimates, how far from optimal is this plan likely to be?To address these issues, we provide a theoretical, vector-based framework for analyzing the costs of query plans under various storage parameter costs. We then use this geometric framework to characterize experimentally a commercial query optimizer. We develop algorithms for extracting detailed information about query plans through narrow optimizer interfaces, and we perform the characterization using database statistics from a published run of the TPC-H benchmark and a wide range of storage parameters.We show that, when data structures such as tables, indexes, and sorted runs reside on different storage devices, the optimizer can derive significant benefits from having accurate and timely information regarding the cost of accessing storage devices."	#*A Characterization of the Sensitivity of Query Optimization to Storage Access Cost Parameters. #@Frederick Reiss, Tapas Kanungo #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a9f7b7602d97033606e3 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e999ffb7602d970224bf32 #%53e99cfdb7602d97025b4b4f #%53e9bb15b7602d9704751494 #%53e9b23ab7602d9703cd785a #%53e9a388b7602d9702c95c69 #%53e9acf6b7602d97036d42b2 #%53e9a495b7602d9702db3994 #%53e9bb53b7602d9704793bc1 #%53e9b768b7602d970430b127 #%53e99832b7602d970205616b #%53e9afbab7602d9703a0a1aa #%53e9a408b7602d9702d1f790 #%53e9b2aab7602d9703d52b6b #%53e9b84ab7602d970440bfa6 #%53e9bd46b7602d97049d5bf6

However, few methods using the relevance feedback are currently available to process relatively complex queries on large image databases. In the case of complex image queries, the feature space and the distance function of the user's perception are usually different from those of the system. This difference leads to the representation of a query with multiple clusters (i.e., regions) in the feature space. Therefore, it is necessary to handle disjunctive queries in the feature space.In this paper, we propose a new content-based image retrieval method using adaptive classification and cluster-merging to find multiple clusters of a complex image query. When the measures of a retrieval method are invariant under linear transformations, the method can achieve the same retrieval quality regardless of the shapes of clusters of a query. Our method achieves the same high retrieval quality regardless of the shapes of clusters of a query since it uses such measures. Extensive experiments show that the result of our method converges to the user's true information need fast, and the retrieval quality of our method is about 22% in recall and 20% in precision better than that of the query expansion approach, and about 34% in recall and about 33% in precision better than that of the query point movement approach, in MARS."	#*Qcluster: Relevance Feedback Using Adaptive Clustering for Content-Based Image Retrieval. #@Deok-Hwan Kim, Chin-Wan Chung #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9ab55b7602d97034e6d89 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e9aefcb7602d970392fd49 #%53e9a091b7602d97029793d5 #%53e99a30b7602d970228f730 #%53e9af46b7602d9703985dd9 #%53e9abf6b7602d97035b44f2 #%53e9a704b7602d9703036673 #%53e9aff4b7602d9703a4b525 #%53e9bd76b7602d9704a17310 #%53e99e1ab7602d97026e1318 #%53e99a8cb7602d9702304728 #%53e9a0cab7602d97029b466b

Temporal coalescing merges the temporal extents of value-equivalent tuples. A temporal extent is usually coalesced offline and stored since coalescing is an expensive operation. But the temporal extent of a tuple with now, times at different granularities, or incomplete times cannot be determined until query evaluation. This paper presents a strategy to partially coalesce temporal extents by identifying regions that are potentially covered.

In this paper we focus on querying wide area sensor databases, containing (XML) data derived from sensors spread over tens to thousands of miles. We present the first scalable system for executing XPATH queries on such databases. The system maintains the logical view of the data as a single XML document, while physically the data is fragmented across any number of host nodes. For scalability, sensor data is stored close to the sensors, but can be cached elsewhere as dictated by the queries. Our design enables self starting distributed queries that jump directly to the lowest common ancestor of the query result, dramatically reducing query response times. We present a novel query-evaluate gather technique (using XSLT) for detecting (1) which data in a local database fragment is part of the query result, and (2) how to gather the missing parts. We define partitioning and cache invariants that ensure that even partial matches on cached data are exploited and that correct answers are returned, despite our dynamic query-driven caching. Experimental results demonstrate that our techniques dramatically increase query throughputs and decrease query response times in wide area sensor databases."	#*Cache-and-Query for Wide Area Sensor Databases. #@Amol Deshpande, Suman Nath, Phillip B.

In this paper, we propose ViST, a novel index structure for searching XML documents. By representing both XML documents and XML queries in structure-encoded sequences, we show that querying XML data is equivalent to finding subsequence matches. Unlike index methods that disassemble a query into multiple sub-queries, and then join the results of these sub-queries to provide the final answers, ViST uses tree structures as the basic unit of query to avoid expensive join operations. Furthermore, ViST provides a unified index on both content and structure of the XML documents, hence it has a performance advantage over methods indexing either just content or structure. ViST supports dynamic index update, and it relies solely on B+ Trees without using any specialized data structures that are not well supported by DBMSs. Our experiments show that ViST is effective, scalable, and efficient in supporting structural queries."	#*ViST: A Dynamic Index Method for Querying XML Data by Tree Structures. #@Haixun Wang, Sanghyun Park, Wei Fan, Philip S.

In its most general form, a data stream is actually an update stream, i.e., comprising data-item deletions as well as insertions. Such massive update streams arise naturally in several application domains (e.g., monitoring of large IP network installations, or processing of retail-chain transactions).Estimating the cardinality of set expressions defined over several (perhaps, distributed) update streams is perhaps one of the most fundamental query classes of interest; as an example, such a query may ask \"what is the number of distinct IP source addresses seen in passing packets from both router R1 and R2 but not router R3?\". Earlier work has only addressed very restricted forms of this problem, focusing solely on the special case of insert-only streams and specific operators (e.g., union). In this paper, we propose the first space-efficient algorithmic solution for estimating the cardinality of full-fledged set expressions over general update streams. Our estimation algorithms are probabilistic in nature and rely on a novel, hash-based synopsis data structure, termed \"2-level hash sketch\". We demonstrate how our 2-level hash sketch synopses can be used to provide low-error, high-confidence estimates for the cardinality of set expressions (including operators such as set union, intersection, and difference) over continuous update streams, using only small space and small processing time per update. Furthermore, our estimators never require rescanning or resampling of past stream items, regardless of the number of deletions in the stream. We also present lower bounds for the problem, demonstrating that the space usage of our estimation algorithms is within small factors of the optimal. Preliminary experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach."	#*Processing Set Expressions over Continuous Update Streams. #@Sumit Ganguly, Minos N.

Correlation refers to the use of values from the outer query block to compute the inner subquery. This is a convenient paradigm for SQL programmers and closely mimics a function invocation paradigm in a typical computer programming language. Queries with correlated subqueries are also often created by SQL generators that translate queries from application domain-specific languages into SQL. Another significant class of queries that use this correlated subquery form is that involving temporal databases using SQL. Performance of these queries is an important consideration particularly in large databases. Several proposals to improve the performance of SQL queries containing correlated subqueries can be found in database literature. One of the main ideas in many of these proposals is to suitably decorrelate the subquery internally to avoid a tuple-at-a-time invocation of the subquery. Magic decorrelation is one method that has been successfully used. Another proposal is to cache the portion of the subquery that is invariant with the changing values of the outer query block. What we propose here is a new technique to handle some typical correlated queries. We go a step further than to simply decorrelate the subquery. By making use of extended window aggregation capabilities, we eliminate redundant access to common tables referenced in the outer query block and the subquery. This technique can be exploited even for non-correlated subqueries. It is possible to get a huge boost in performance for queries that can exploit this technique, which we call WinMagic. This technique was implemented in IBM® DB2® Universal Database\" Version 7 and Version 8. In addition to improving DB2 customer queries that contain aggregation subqueries, it has provided significant improvements in a number of TPCH benchmarks that IBM has published since late in 2001."	#*WinMagic : Subquery Elimination Using Window Aggregation. #@Calisto Zuzarte, Hamid Pirahesh, Wenbin Ma, Qi Cheng, Linqi Liu, Kwai Wong #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a41cb7602d9702d38bb4 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e9a70bb7602d9703042d0b #%53e99e3fb7602d9702705231 #%53e9a9c4b7602d9703323382 #%53e9a704b7602d97030359ae #%53e9a8ffb7602d9703251ecc

We describe a number of optimization techniques to make the lazy XPush machine more efficient, both in terms of space and time. The combination of these optimizations results in high, sustained throughput. For example, if the total number of atomic predicates in the filters is up to 200000, then the throughput is at least 0.5 MB/sec: it increases to 4.5 MB/sec when each fllter contains a single predicate."	#*Stream Processing of XPath Queries with Predicates. #@Ashish Kumar Gupta, Dan Suciu #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a5a8b7602d9702ed4a4f #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e997ddb7602d9701fd5114 #%53e9adfeb7602d970380545c #%53e9b822b7602d97043d8ecf #%53e9ba8ab7602d97046ad78a #%53e99b36b7602d97023d2947 #%53e9978ab7602d9701f47d76 #%53e9ab69b7602d9703504dd9 #%53e9a3f4b7602d9702d0a2c5 #%53e9b430b7602d9703f29976 #%53e9a351b7602d9702c5e241 #%53e9b677b7602d97041de2cb #%53e9b866b7602d97044302a9 #%53e9ae04b7602d970380f064 #%53e9bb01b7602d97047376a9

Evaluating keyword search queries over hierarchical XML documents, as opposed to (conceptually) flat HTML documents, introduces many new challenges. First, XML keyword search queries do not always return entire documents, but can return deeply nested XML elements that contain the desired keywords. Second, the nested structure of XML implies that the notion of ranking is no longer at the granularity of a document, but at the granularity of an XML element. Finally, the notion of keyword proximity is more complex in the hierarchical XML data model. In this paper, we present the XRANK system that is designed to handle these novel features of XML keyword search. Our experimental results show that XRANK offers both space and performance benefits when compared with existing approaches. An interesting feature of XRANK is that it naturally generalizes a hyperlink based HTML search engine such as Google. XRANK can thus be used to query a mix of HTML and XML documents."	#*XRANK: Ranked Keyword Search over XML Documents. #@Lin Guo, Feng Shao, Chavdar Botev, Jayavel Shanmugasundaram #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a1c3b7602d9702abdc4a #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e9a80cb7602d9703150532 #%53e9a812b7602d9703157cf9 #%53e9ab7eb7602d970352713a #%53e9aa61b7602d97033d54e4 #%53e9ba95b7602d97046c02d5 #%53e9a562b7602d9702e86c0e #%53e99ca1b7602d9702551de0 #%53e9a9d3b7602d97033335eb #%53e9bb1cb7602d97047562b9 #%53e9a965b7602d97032bad69 #%53e9acefb7602d97036cb25a #%53e9a9c4b7602d9703322977 #%53e9afa0b7602d97039ea2d9 #%53e9a3c7b7602d9702cd90f5 #%53e9b601b7602d97041586b9 #%53e9bc80b7602d970490276f #%53e9af2db7602d9703966c60 #%53e9ab00b7602d9703484902 #%53e9b8dab7602d97044bba1a #%53e9a1c3b7602d9702abdc4a #%53e9a7c0b7602d97030fc0dc #%53e9aadfb7602d970345ce1b #%53e9b4b4b7602d9703fccc99

Currently, the most efficient algorithm is NN (nearest neighbors), which applies the divide -and-conquer framework on datasets indexed by R-trees. Although NN has some desirable features (such as high speed for returning the initial skyline points, applicability to arbitrary data distributions and dimensions), it also presents several inherent disadvantages (need for duplicate elimination if d2, multiple accesses of the same node, large space overhead). In this paper we develop BBS (branch-and-bound skyline), a progressive algorithm also based on nearest neighbor search, which is IO optimal, i.e., it performs a single access only to those R-tree nodes that may contain skyline points. Furthermore, it does not retrieve duplicates and its space overhead is significantly smaller than that of NN. Finally, BBS is simple to implement and can be efficiently applied to a variety of alternative skyline queries. An analytical and experimental comparison shows that BBS outperforms NN (usually by orders of magnitude) under all problem instances."	#*An Optimal and Progressive Algorithm for Skyline Queries. #@Dimitris Papadias, Yufei Tao, Greg Fu, Bernhard Seeger #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b160b7602d9703be7f60 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e999ffb7602d970224bf32 #%53e9a6d0b7602d97030071e1 #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e9b048b7602d9703aa8491 #%53e99f86b7602d970285a5d7 #%53e9ae63b7602d970387d038 #%53e9ae69b7602d97038835e7 #%53e9bad0b7602d97046fd79f #%53e9bddbb7602d9704a89971

Especially for CAD applications, suitable similarity models can help to reduce the cost of developing and producing new parts by maximizing the reuse of existing parts. Most of the existing similarity models are based on feature vectors. In this paper, we shortly review three models which pursue this paradigm. Based on the most promising of these three models, we explain how sets of feature vectors can be used for more effective and still efficient similarity search. We first introduce an intuitive distance measure on sets of feature vectors together with an algorithm for its efficient computation. Furthermore, we present a method for accelerating the processing of similarity queries on vector set data. The experimental evaluation is based on two real world test data sets and points out that our new similarity approach yields more meaningful results in comparatively short time."	#*Using Sets of Feature Vectors for Similarity Search on Voxelized CAD Objects. #@Hans-Peter Kriegel, Stefan Brecheisen, Peer Kröger, Martin Pfeifle, Matthias Schubert #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99ddbb7602d970269ddb9 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e99a48b7602d97022a7d7b #%53e99b21b7602d97023b8d6f #%53e9bb72b7602d97047b415b #%53e9b145b7602d9703bc86e8 #%53e9a464b7602d9702d805a0 #%53e99f42b7602d9702810ff0 #%53e9aca8b7602d9703686837 #%53e9b1a9b7602d9703c33e40 #%53e99fefb7602d97028cc813 #%53e9a074b7602d970295e95e #%53e9b716b7602d97042afc74 #%53e9b904b7602d97044ea69e #%53e9a263b7602d9702b68a16 #%53e9aadfb7602d9703461883 #%53e9b03db7602d9703a9e799 #%53e9b2b1b7602d9703d59484

One commonly-used technique for approximate query answering is sampling. For many aggregation queries, appropriately constructed biased (non-uniform) samples can provide more accurate approximations than a uniform sample. The optimal type of bias, however, varies from query to query. In this paper, we describe an approximate query processing technique that dynamically constructs an appropriately biased sample for each query by combining samples selected from a family of non-uniform samples that are constructed during a pre-processing phase. We show that dynamic selection of appropriate portions of previously constructed samples can provide more accurate approximate answers than static, non-adaptive usage of uniform or non-uniform samples."	#*Dynamic Sample Selection for Approximate Query Processing. #@Brian Babcock, Surajit Chaudhuri, Gautam Das #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b6b9b7602d970423eab6 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e9ad98b7602d9703792b86 #%53e99bfeb7602d97024a81ca #%53e9ae17b7602d9703825532 #%53e99a8cb7602d9702303d32 #%53e9b7adb7602d97043554b1 #%53e9aa2cb7602d970339b778 #%53e9b137b7602d9703bb69d8 #%53e9bb72b7602d97047b56c0 #%53e9b3a4b7602d9703e8a09a #%53e9ab38b7602d97034c696d #%53e99967b7602d97021a75ab #%53e9ae48b7602d970385cf97

Relational OLAP (ROLAP) applications have to emulate them using joins, recently introduced SQL Window Functions [18] and complex and inefficient CASE expressions. The designated place in SQL for specifying calculations is the SELECT clause, which is extremely limiting and forces the user to generate queries using nested views, subqueries and complex joins. Furthermore, SQL-query optimizer is pre-occupied with determining efficient join orders and choosing optimal access methods and largely disregards optimization of complex numerical formulas. Execution methods concentrated on efficient computation of a cube [11], [16] rather than on random access structures for inter-row calculations. This has created a gap that has been filled by spreadsheets and specialized MOLAP engines, which are good at formulas for mathematical modeling but lack the formalism of the relational model, are difficult to manage, and exhibit scalability problems. This paper presents SQL extensions involving array based calculations for complex modeling. In addition, we present optimizations, access structures and execution models for processing them efficiently."	#*Spreadsheets in RDBMS for OLAP. #@Andrew Witkowski, Srikanth Bellamkonda, Tolga Bozkaya, Gregory Dorman, Nathan Folkert, Abhinav Gupta, Lei Sheng, Sankar Subramanian #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b4d9b7602d9703ff948d #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e99aacb7602d97023295ca #%53e99a5cb7602d97022c411f #%53e9ac8fb7602d9703666e4e #%53e9b53cb7602d970407580f #%53e9a8ffb7602d9703251ecc #%53e9b5ceb7602d9704116fc0 #%53e9b716b7602d97042ac87b

The novelty of AIG consists in semantic attributes and their dependency relations for controlling context-dependent, DTD-directed construction of XML documents, as well as for checking XML constraints in parallel with document-generation. We also present cost-based optimization techniques for efficiently evaluating AIGs, including algorithms for merging queries and for scheduling queries on multiple data sources.

These are XML documents where some data is given explicitly while other parts are given only intensionally by means of embedded calls to web services that can be called to generate the required information. By the sole presence of Web services, dynamic documents already include inherently some form of distributed computation. A higher level of distribution that also allows (fragments of) dynamic documents to be distributed and/or replicated over several sites is highly desirable in today's Web architecture, and in fact is also relevant for regular (non dynamic) documents.The goal of this paper is to study new issues raised by the distribution and replication of dynamic XML data. Our study has originated in the context of the Active XML system [1, 3, 22] but the results are applicable to many other systems supporting dynamic XML data. Starting from a data model and a query language, we describe a complete framework for distributed and replicated dynamic XML documents. We provide a comprehensive cost model for query evaluation and show how it applies to user queries and service calls. Finally, we describe an algorithm that, for a given peer, chooses data and services that the peer should replicate to improve the efficiency of maintaining and querying its dynamic data."	#*Dynamic XML documents with distribution and replication. #@Serge Abiteboul, Angela Bonifati, Gregory Cobena, Ioana Manolescu, Tova Milo #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b8ccb7602d97044aba70 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e9ab78b7602d970351d73e #%53e9af61b7602d97039a1c54 #%53e998f0b7602d970212bbad #%53e99b16b7602d97023a7500 #%53e9a841b7602d970318b89c #%53e9b326b7602d9703df6eca #%53e9a6bbb7602d9702ff0011 #%53e9aee4b7602d9703911d2a #%53e99894b7602d97020d08a1 #%53e9bb01b7602d97047376a9

We employ a service-oriented approach, in that data are encapsulated in services. Direct querying of data is also supported by an XML-based query language. In this paper, we present our research results along the following topics: (a) infrastructure support, including mobile peers and the creation of context-dependent communities, (b) metadata management for services and peers, including location-dependent data, (c) filters for efficiently routing path queries on hierarchical data, and (d) querying using the AXML language that incorporates service calls inside XML documents."	#*DBGlobe: a service-oriented P2P system for global computing. #@Evaggelia Pitoura, Serge Abiteboul, Dieter Pfoser, George Samaras, Michalis Vazirgiannis #t2003 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b79fb7602d970434728a #%53e9a480b7602d9702d9f5ca #%53e9a2ceb7602d9702bd6de6 #%53e9b8ccb7602d97044aba70 #%53e9af12b7602d970394c2f9

In many situations, high quality multimedia streams may be required for providing detailed information of the hot spots in a large scale network. With the limited capabilities of sensor node and sensor network, it is very difficult to support multimedia streams in current sensor network structure. In this paper, we propose to enhance the sensor network by deploying limited number of mobile \"swarms\". The swarm nodes have much higher capabilities than the sensor nodes in terms of both hardware functionalities and networking capabilities. The mobile swarms can be directed to the hot spots in the sensor network to provide detailed information of the intended area. With the help of mobile swarms, high quality of multimedia streams can be supported in the large scale sensor network without too much cost. The wireless backbone network for connecting different swarms and the routing schemes for supporting such a unified architecture is also discussed and verified via simulations."	#*Multimedia streaming in large-scale sensor networks with mobile swarms. #@Mario Gerla, Kaixin Xu #t2003 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9a03bb7602d9702923b1c #%53e9b8f5b7602d97044da476

Significant communication overhead is incurred in the presence of rapid update streams, and we propose a new technique for reducing the overhead. Users register continuous queries with precision requirements at the central stream processor, which installs filters at remote data sources. The filters adapt to changing conditions to minimize stream rates while guaranteeing that all continuous queries still receive the updates necessary to provide answers of adequate precision at all times. Our approach enables applications to trade precision for communication overhead at a fine granularity by individually adjusting the precision constraints of continuous queries over streams in a multi-query workload.

The sensor readings are reported to a centralized database system, and are subsequently used to answer queries. Due to continuous changes in these values and limited resources (e.g., network bandwidth and battery power), the database may not be able to keep track of the actual values of the entities, and use the old values instead. Queries that use these old values may produce incorrect answers. However, if the degree of uncertainty between the actual data value and the database value is limited, one can place more confidence in the answers to the queries. In this paper, we present a frame-work that represents uncertainty of sensor data. Depending on the amount of uncertainty information given to the application, different levels of imprecision are presented in a query answer. We examine the situations when answer imprecision can be represented qualitatively and quantitatively. We propose a new kind of probabilistic queries called Probabilistic Threshold Query, which requires answers to have probabilities larger than a certain threshold value. We also study techniques for evaluating queries under different details of uncertainty, and investigate the tradeoff between data uncertainty, answer accuracy and computation costs."	#*Managing uncertainty in sensor database. #@Reynold Cheng, Sunil Prabhakar #t2003 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b023b7602d9703a812bc #%53e9bb23b7602d970475cd73 #%53e997f1b7602d9701fee590 #%53e9adffb7602d970380be2d #%53e9a1fbb7602d9702afe063 #%53e9b945b7602d970452fa5e #%53e9b4a1b7602d9703fadfb7 #%53e9a6a6b7602d9702fda536 #%53e9ba32b7602d970463f1c0

In addition, we provide analytical models for estimating the expected size of the validity region.

In this framework, the database elements are vectors in a Euclidean space. Given a query vector in the same space, the goal is to find elements of the database that are similar to the query. In our approach, a small number of independent \"voters\" rank the database elements based on similarity to the query. These rankings are then combined by a highly efficient aggregation algorithm. Our methodology leads both to techniques for computing approximate nearest neighbors and to a conceptually rich alternative to nearest neighbors.One instantiation of our methodology is as follows. Each voter projects all the vectors (database elements and the query) on a random line (different for each voter), and ranks the database elements based on the proximity of the projections to the projection of the query. The aggregation rule picks the database element that has the best median rank. This combination has several appealing features. On the theoretical side, we prove that with high probability, it produces a result that is a (1 + ε) factor approximation to the Euclidean nearest neighbor. On the practical side, it turns out to be extremely efficient, often exploring no more than 5% of the data to obtain very high-quality results. This method is also database-friendly, in that it accesses data primarily in a pre-defined order without random accesses, and, unlike other methods for approximate nearest neighbors, requires almost no extra storage. Also, we extend our approach to deal with the k nearest neighbors.We conduct two sets of experiments to evaluate the efficacy of our methods. Our experiments include two scenarios where nearest neighbors are typically employed---similarity search and classification problems. In both cases, we study the performance of our methods with respect to several evaluation criteria, and conclude that they are uniformly excellent, both in terms of quality of results and in terms of efficiency."	#*Efficient similarity search and classification via rank aggregation. #@Ronald Fagin, Ravi Kumar, D.

Various join types are considered, namely the set containment, set equality, and set overlap joins.

The sensed data must be gathered and transmitted to a base station where it is further processed for end-user queries. Since the network consists of low-cost nodes with limited battery power, power efficient methods must be employed for data gathering and aggregation in order to achieve long network lifetimes.In an environment where in a round of communication each of the sensor nodes has data to send to a base station, it is important to minimize the total energy consumed by the system in a round so that the system lifetime is maximized. With the use of data fusion and aggregation techniques, while minimizing the total energy per round, if power consumption per node can be balanced as well, a near optimal data gathering and routing scheme can be achieved in terms of network lifetime.So far, besides the conventional protocol of direct transmission, two elegant protocols called LEACH and PEGASIS have been proposed to maximize the lifetime of a sensor network. In this paper, we propose two new algorithms under name PEDAP (Power Efficient Data gathering and Aggregation Protocol), which are near optimal minimum spanning tree based routing schemes, where one of them is the power-aware version of the other. Our simulation results show that our algorithms perform well both in systems where base station is far away from and where it is in the center of the field. PEDAP achieves between 4x to 20x improvement in network lifetime compared with LEACH, and about three times improvement compared with PEGASIS."	#*Power efficient data gathering and aggregation in wireless sensor networks. #@Hüseyin Özgür Tan, Ibrahim Korpeoglu #t2003 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9a6c3b7602d9702ff5623 #%53e9b61bb7602d9704175973 #%53e9bd9fb7602d9704a4c3ad #%53e9b2c6b7602d9703d6da9e #%53e9a38fb7602d9702ca030b #%53e9a0cab7602d97029b2b85 #%53e99d73b7602d970262b052 #%53e998b8b7602d97020f421b

Since XML data is irregular and verbose, the disk space and the network bandwidth are wasted. To overcome the verbosity problem, the research on compressors for XML data has been conducted. However, some XML compressors do not support querying compressed data, while other XML compressors which support querying compressed data blindly encode tags and data values using predefined encoding methods. Thus, the query performance on compressed XML data is degraded.In this paper, we propose XPRESS, an XML compressor which supports direct and efficient evaluations of queries on compressed XML data. XPRESS adopts a novel encoding method, called reverse arithmetic encoding, which is intended for encoding label paths of XML data, and applies diverse encoding methods depending on the types of data values. Experimental results with real life data sets show that XPRESS achieves significant improvements on query performance for compressed XML data and reasonable compression ratios. On the average, the query performance of XPRESS is 2.83 times better than that of an existing XML compressor and the compression ratio of XPRESS is 73%."	#*XPRESS: A Queriable Compression for XML Data. #@Jun-Ki Min, Myung-Jae Park, Chin-Wan Chung #t2003 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99c12b7602d97024be997 #%53e99d37b7602d97025ef628 #%53e9ab0eb7602d970349526b #%53e9aca1b7602d970367fe7e #%53e9be57b7602d9704b1a06c #%53e99a56b7602d97022bc9b1 #%53e9a3c7b7602d9702cd90f5 #%53e9b326b7602d9703df6eca #%53e9b4a5b7602d9703fb5071 #%53e9bb4bb7602d97047886bd

Therefore, it is important to integrate \"information retrieval style\" query evaluation, which is well-suited for natural language text, with standard \"database style\" query evaluation, which handles structured queries efficiently. Relevance scoring is central to information retrieval. In the case of XML, this operation becomes more complex because the data required for scoring could reside not directly in an element itself but also in its descendant elements.In this paper, we propose a bulk-algebra, TIX, and describe how it can be used as a basis for integrating information retrieval techniques into a standard pipelined database query evaluation engine. We develop new evaluation strategies essential to obtaining good performance, including a stack-based TermJoin algorithm for efficiently scoring composite elements. We report results from an extensive experimental evaluation, which show, among other things, that the new TermJoin access method outperforms a direct implementation of the same functionality using standard operators by a large factor."	#*Querying Structured Text in an XML Database. #@Shurug Al-Khalifa, Cong Yu, H.

This expands the existing suite of algorithms for set joins on simpler predicates such as, set containment, equality and non-zero overlap. We start with a basic inverted index based probing method and add a sequence of optimizations that result in one to two orders of magnitude improvement in running time. The algorithm folds in a data partitioning strategy that can work efficiently with an index compressed to fit in any available amount of main memory.

Under this assumption, the goal is to achieve security against external attacks (e.g. from hackers) and possibly also against users trying to obtain information beyond their privileges, for instance by some type of statistical inference. However, for many database applications such as health information systems there exist conflicting interests of the database owner and the users or organizations interacting with the database, and also between the users.

Semantic heterogeneity can arise at the schema level and at the data level. At the schema level, sources can differ in relations, attribute and tag names, data normalization, levels of detail, and the coverage of a particular domain. The problem of reconciling schema-level heterogeneity is often referred to as schema matching or schema mapping. At the data level, we find different representations of the same real-world entities (e.g., people, companies, publications, etc.). Reconciling data-level heterogeneity is referred to as data deduplication, record linkage, and entity/object matching. To exacerbate the heterogeneity challenges, schema elements of one source can be represented as data in another. This special issue presents a set of articles that describe recent work on semantic heterogeneity at the schema level."	#*Introduction to the Special Issue on Semantic Integration. #@AnHai Doan, Natalya Fridman Noy, Alon Y.

For modelling and integrating Web databases, the very first challenge is to understand what a query interface says- or what query capabilities a source supports. Such automatic extraction of interface semantics is challenging, as query forms are created autonomously. Our approach builds on the observation that, across myriad sources, query forms seem to reveal some \"concerted structure,\" by sharing common building blocks. Toward this insight, we hypothesize the existence of a hidden syntax that guides the creation of query interfaces, albeit from different sources. This hypothesis effectively transforms query interfaces into a visual language with a non-prescribed grammar- and, thus, their semantic understanding a parsing problem. Such a paradigm enables principled solutions for both declaratively representing common patterns, by a derived grammar, and systematically interpreting query forms, by a global parsing mechanism. To realize this paradigm, we must address the challenges of a hypothetical syntax- that it is to be derived, and that it is secondary to the input. At the heart of our form extractor, we thus develop a 2P grammar and a best-effort parser, which together realize a parsing mechanism for a hypothetical syntax. Our experiments show the promise of this approach-it achieves above 85% accuracy for extracting query conditions across random sources."	#*Understanding Web Query Interfaces: Best-Effort Parsing with Hidden Syntax. #@Zhen Zhang, Bin He, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9adb6b7602d97037b6b56 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9ac5bb7602d9703629504 #%53e99a14b7602d97022685ac #%53e9a026b7602d9702909b07 #%53e9b6a2b7602d970421ab6f #%53e9a089b7602d970296f76e #%53e9a03bb7602d9702921178 #%53e9a94cb7602d97032a38ae #%53e99940b7602d970217f0f4 #%53e99f11b7602d97027deea2 #%53e9a689b7602d9702fbae9b #%53e9a396b7602d9702ca7cda

Such networks pose new challenges in data processing and dissemination because of the limited resources (processing, bandwidth, energy) that such devices possess. In this paper we propose a new technique for compressing multiple streams containing historical data from each sensor. Our method exploits correlation and redundancy among multiple measurements on the same sensor and achieves high degree of data reduction while managing to capture even the smallest details of the recorded measurements. The key to our technique is the base signal, a series of values extracted from the real measurements, used for encoding piece-wise linear correlations among the collected data values. We provide efficient algorithms for extracting the base signal features from the data and for encoding the measurements using these features. Our experiments demonstrate that our method by far outperforms standard approximation techniques like Wavelets.

Selectivity estimation has been studied for relational database systems, but to date has only received little attention in SDBMS. In this paper, we introduce novel methods that permit high-quality selectivity estimation for spatial joins and range queries. Our techniques can be constructed in a single scan over the input, handle inserts and deletes to the database incrementally, and hence they can also be used for processing of streaming spatial data. In contrast to previous approaches, our techniques return approximate results that come with provable probabilistic quality guarantees.

We present a novel fine-grained access control model based on authorization views that allows \"authorization-transparent\" querying; that is, user queries can be phrased in terms of the database relations, and are valid if they can be answered using only the information contained in these authorization views. We extend earlier work on authorization-transparent querying by introducing a new notion of validity, conditional validity. We give a powerful set of inference rules to check for query validity.

This paper presents a new approximate approach for automatic online subsequence similarity matching over massive data streams. With a simultaneous on-line segmentation and pruning algorithm over the incoming stream, the resulting piecewise linear representation of the data stream features high sensitivity and accuracy. The similarity definition is based on a permutation followed by a metric distance function, which provides the similarity search with flexibility, sensitivity and scalability. Also, the metric-based indexing methods can be applied for speed-up. To reduce the system burden, the event-driven similarity search is performed only when there is a potential event. The query sequence is the most recent subsequence of piecewise data representation of the incoming stream which is automatically generated by the system.

Manually creating matches is extremely tedious and error-prone. Hence many recent works have focused on automating the matching process. To date, however, virtually all of these works deal only with one-to-one (1-1) matches, such as address = location. They do not consider the important class of more complex matches, such as address = concat (city, state) and room-pric = room-rate* (1 + tax-rate).We describe the iMAP system which semi-automatically discovers both 1-1 and complex matches. iMAP reformulates schema matching as a search in an often very large or infinite match space. To search effectively, it employs a set of searchers, each discovering specific types of complex matches. To further improve matching accuracy, iMAP exploits a variety of domain knowledge, including past complex matches, domain integrity constraints, and overlap data. Finally, iMAP introduces a novel feature that generates explanation of predicted matches, to provide insights into the matching process and suggest actions to converge on correct matches quickly. We apply iMAP to several real-world domains to match relational tables, and show that it discovers both 1-1 and complex matches with high accuracy."	#*iMAP: Discovering Complex Mappings between Database Schemas. #@Robin Dhamankar, Yoonkyong Lee, AnHai Doan, Alon Y.

To address this problem, we provide a bi-level Bernoulli sampling scheme that combines the row-level and page-level sampling methods currently used in most commercial systems. By adjusting the parameters of the method, the user can systematically trade off processing speed and statistical precision---the appropriate choice of parameter settings becomes a query optimization problem. We indicate the SQL extensions needed to support bi-level sampling and determine the optimal parameter settings for an important class of sampling queries with explicit time or accuracy constraints. As might be expected, row-level sampling is preferable when data values on each page are homogeneous, whereas page-level sampling should be used when data values on a page vary widely. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that in many cases the optimal sampling policy is of the \"bang-bang\" type: we identify a \"page-heterogeneity index\" (PHI) such that optimal sampling is as \"row-like\" as possible if the PHI is less than 1 and as \"page-like\" as possible otherwise. The PHI depends upon both the query and the data, and can be estimated by means of a pilot sample. Because pilot sampling can be nontrivial to implement in commercial database systems, we also give a heuristic method for setting the sampling parameters; the method avoids pilot sampling by using a small number of summary statistics that are maintained in the system catalog. Results from over 1100 experiments on 372 real and synthetic data sets show that the heuristic method performs optimally about half of the time, and yields sampling errors within a factor of 2.2 of optimal about 93% of the time. The heuristic method is stable over a wide range of sampling rates and performs best in the most critical cases, where the data is highly clustered or skewed."	#*A Bi-Level Bernoulli Scheme for Database Sampling. #@Peter J.

A continuous stream in our framework consists of a finite XML document followed by a continuous stream of updates. The unit of update is an XML fragment, which can relate to other fragments through system-generated unique IDs. The reconstruction of temporal data from continuous updates at a current time is never materialized and historical queries operate directly on the fragmented streams.

Our extensions use time projections to capture time-sliding windows, version control for tuple-based windows, and coincidence queries to synchronize events between streams.

Traditionally, the problem of matching multiple schemas has essentially relied on finding pairwise-attribute correspondences in isolation. In contrast, we propose a new matching paradigm, holistic schema matching, to match many schemas at the same time and find all matchings at once. By handling a set of schemas together, we can explore their context information that reflects the semantic correspondences among attributes. Such information is not available when schemas are matched only in pairs. As the realizations of holistic schema matching, we develop two alternative approaches: global evaluation and local evaluation. Global evaluation exhaustively assesses all possible \"models,\" where a model expresses all attribute matchings. In particular, we propose the MGS framework for such global evaluation, building upon the hypothesis of the existence of a hidden schema model that probabilistically generates the schemas we observed. On the other hand, local evaluation independently assesses every single matching to incrementally construct such a model. In particular, we develop the DCM framework for local evaluation, building upon the observation that co-occurrence patterns across schemas often reveal the complex relationships of attributes. We apply our approaches to match query interfaces on the deep Web. The result shows the effectiveness of both the MGS and DCM approaches, which together demonstrate the promise of holistic schema matching."	#*A Holistic Paradigm for Large Scale Schema Matching. #@Bin He, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang #t2004 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9ad63b7602d970374bbc7 #%53e9a9beb7602d970331c113 #%53e9bdfdb7602d9704aad059 #%53e9a609b7602d9702f35f7e #%53e99940b7602d970217f0f4 #%53e9b27bb7602d9703d21ece #%53e9ae69b7602d9703883338 #%53e9a958b7602d97032aef11 #%53e9a8eab7602d97032392e8

There are many possible ways to choose the polynomial, including (continuous)Fourier transforms, splines, non-linear regressino, etc. Some of these possiblities have indeed been studied beofre. We hypothesize that one of the best possibilities is the polynomial that minimizes the maximum deviation from the true value, which is called the minimax polynomial. Minimax approximation is particularly meaningful for indexing because in a branch-and-bound search (i.e., for finding nearest neighbours), the smaller the maximum deviation, the more pruning opportunities there exist. However, in general, among all the polynomials of the same degree, the optimal minimax polynomial is very hard to compute. However, it has been shown thta the Chebyshev approximation is almost identical to the optimal minimax polynomial, and is easy to compute [16]. Thus, in this paper, we explore how to use the Chebyshev polynomials as a basis for approximating and indexing d-dimenstional trajectories.The key analytic result of this paper is the Lower Bounding Lemma. that is, we show that the Euclidean distance between two d-dimensional trajectories is lower bounded by the weighted Euclidean distance between the two vectors of Chebyshev coefficients. this lemma is not trivial to show, and it ensures that indexing with Chebyshev cofficients aedmits no false negatives. To complement that analystic result, we conducted comprehensive experimental evaluation with real and generated 1-dimensional to 4-dimensional data sets. We compared the proposed schem with the Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA) scheme. Our preliminary results indicate that in all situations we tested, Chebyshev indexing dominates APCA in pruning power, I/O and CPU costs."	#*Indexing Spatio-Temporal Trajectories with Chebyshev Polynomials. #@Yuhan Cai, Raymond T.

Recent database research has shown that most of the memory stalls are due to second-level cache data misses and first-level instruction cache misses. While a lot of research has focused on reducing the data cache misses, relatively little research has been done on improving the instruction cache performance of database systems.We first answer the question \"Why does a database system incur so many instruction cache misses?\" We demonstrate that current demand-pull pipelined query execution engines suffer from significant instruction cache thrashing between different operators. We propose techniques to buffer database operations during query execution to avoid instruction cache thrashing. We implement a new light-weight \"buffer\" operator and study various factors which may affect the cache performance. We also introduce a plan refinement algorithm that considers the query plan and decides whether it is beneficial to add additional \"buffer\" operators and where to put them. The benefit is mainly from better instruction locality and better hardware branch prediction. Our techniques can be easily integrated into current database systems without significant changes. Our experiments in a memory-resident PostgreSQL database system show that buffering techniques can reduce the number of instruction cache misses by up to 80% and improve query performance by up to 15%."	#*Buffering Database Operations for Enhanced Instruction Cache Performance. #@Jingren Zhou, Kenneth A.

In this paper, we study fundamental challenges that arise when we try to integrate these two querying paradigms.While keyword search is based on approximate matching, XPath has exact match semantics. We address this mismatch by considering queries on structure as a \"template\", and looking for answers that best match this template and the full-text search. To achieve this, we provide an elegant definition of relaxation on structure and define primitive operators to span the space of relaxations. Query answering is now based on ranking potential answers on structural and full-text search conditions. We set out certain desirable principles for ranking schemes and propose natural ranking schemes that adhere to these principles. We develop efficient algorithms for answering top-K queries and discuss results from a comprehensive set of experiments that demonstrate the utility and scalability of the proposed framework and algorithms."	#*FleXPath: Flexible Structure and Full-Text Querying for XML. #@Sihem Amer-Yahia, Laks V.

Early integration efforts focused on connectivity at the physical and syntactic layers. Great strides were made; there are many commercial tools available, for example to assist with enterprise application integration. It is now recognized that physical and syntactic connectivity is not adequate. A variety of research systems have been developed addressing some of the semantic issues. In this paper, we argue that ontologies in particular and semantics-based technologies in general will play a key role in achieving seamless connectivity.

That is, if no value exists for a given combination of dimension values, no row exists in the fact table. Densities of 0.1-2% are very common. However, users may want to view the data in a dense form, with rows for all combination of dimension values displayed even when no fact data exists for them. For example, if a product did not sell during a particular time period, users may still want to see the product for that time period with zero sales value next to it. Moreover, analytic window functions [1] and the SQL model clause [2] can more easily express time series calculations if data is dense along the time dimension because dense data will fill a consistent number of rows for each period.Data densification is the process of converting spare data into dense form. The current SQL technique for densification (using the combination of DISTINCT, CROSS JOIN and OUTER JOIN operations) is extremely unintuitive, difficult to express and inefficient to compute. Hence, we propose an extension to the ANSI SQL join operator, referred to as \"PARTITIONED OUTER JOIN\", which allows for a succinct expression of densification along the dimensions of interest. We also present various algorithms to evaluate the new join operator efficiently and compare it with existing methods of doing the equivalent operation. We also define a new window function \"LAST_VALUE (IGNORE NULLS)\" which is very useful with partitioned outer join."	#*Data Densification in a Relational Database System. #@Abhinav Gupta, Sankar Subramanian, Srikanth Bellamkonda, Tolga Bozkaya, Nathan Folkert, Lei Sheng, Andrew Witkowski #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9bad7b7602d9704705965 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9b53cb7602d970407580f #%53e9b4d9b7602d9703ff948d

In this paper, we present a generalized architecture for adaptive query processing and introduce a new technique, called adaptive data partitioning (ADP), which is based on the idea of dividing the source data into regions, each executed by different, complementary plans. We show how this model can be applied in novel ways to not only correct for underestimated selectivity and cardinality values, but also to discover and exploit order in the source data, and to detect and exploit source data that can be effectively pre-aggregated.

This association can be arbitrarily complex, i.e. one or more features might be dependent from a combination of several other features. Well-known methods like the principal components analysis (PCA) can perfectly find correlations which are global, linear, not hidden in a set of noise vectors, and uniform, i.e. the same type of correlation is exhibited in all feature vectors. In many applications such as medical diagnosis, molecular biology, time sequences, or electronic commerce, however, correlations are not global since the dependency between features can be different in different subgroups of the set. In this paper, we propose a method called 4C (Computing Correlation Connected Clusters) to identify local subgroups of the data objects sharing a uniform but arbitrarily complex correlation. Our algorithm is based on a combination of PCA and density-based clustering (DBSCAN). Our method has a determinate result and is robust against noise. A broad comparative evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of 4C over competing methods such as DBSCAN, CLIQUE and ORCLUS."	#*Computing Clusters of Correlation Connected Objects. #@Christian Böhm, Karin Kailing, Peer Kröger, Arthur Zimek #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a455b7602d9702d724e6 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9a839b7602d970318501b #%53e9b2dbb7602d9703d9158f #%53e9a1eeb7602d9702af0954 #%53e9b2aab7602d9703d5104d #%53e99beab7602d970249372d #%53e9b289b7602d9703d2f078 #%53e9a074b7602d970295e95e #%53e9b2b1b7602d9703d59484 #%53e9b8a1b7602d970447e71b #%53e999e0b7602d97022266d3 #%53e9b7c1b7602d970436eabb

It is challenging to optimize queries that contain outerjoins because outerjoins do not always commute with inner joins. Previous work has studied this problem and provided techniques that allow certain reordering of the join sequences. However, the optimization of outerjoin queries is still not as powerful as that of inner joins.An inner join query can always be canonically represented as a sequence of Cartesian products of all relations, followed by a sequence of selection operations, each applying a conjunct in the join predicates. This canonical abstraction is very powerful because it enables the optimizer to use any join sequence for plan generation. Unfortunately, such a canonical abstraction for outerjoin queries has not been developed. As a result, existing techniques always exclude certain join sequences from planning, which can lead to a severe performance penalty.Given a query consisting of a sequence of inner and outer joins, we, for the first time, present a canonical abstraction based on three operations: outer Cartesian products, nullification, and best match. Like the inner join abstraction, our outerjoin abstraction permits all join sequences, and preserves the property of both commutativity and transitivity among predicates. This allows us to generate plans that are very desirable for performance reasons but that couldn't be done before. We present an algorithm that produces such a canonical abstraction, and a method that extends an inner-join optimizer to generate plans in an expanded search space. We also describe an efficient implementation of the best match operation using the OLAP functionalities in SQL:1999.

However, this flexibility makes it challenging to develop a bulk algebra, which typically manipulates sets of objects with identical structure. A set of XML elements, say of type book, may have members that vary greatly in structure, e.g. in the number of author sub-elements. This kind of heterogeneity may permeate the entire document in a recursive fashion: e.g., different authors of the same or different book may in turn greatly vary in structure. Even when the document conforms to a schema, the flexible nature of schemas for XML still allows such significant variations in structure among elements in a collection. Bulk processing of such heterogeneous sets is problematic.In this paper, we introduce the notion of logical classes (LC) of pattern tree nodes, and generalize the notion of pattern tree matching to handle node logical classes. This abstraction pays off significantly in allowing us to reason with an inherently heterogeneous collection of elements in a uniform, homogeneous way. Based on this, we define a Tree Logical Class (TLC) algebra that is capable of handling the heterogeneity arising in XML query processing, while avoiding redundant work. We present an algorithm to obtain a TLC algebra expression from an XQuery statement (for a large fragment of XQuery). We show how to implement the TLC algebra efficiently, introducing the nest-join as an important physical operator for XML query processing. We show that evaluation plans generated using the TLC algebra not only are simpler but also perform better than those generated by competing approaches. TLC is the algebra used in the Timber [8] system developed at the University of Michigan."	#*Tree Logical Classes for Efficient Evaluation of XQuery. #@Stelios Paparizos, Yuqing Wu, Laks V. S.

Horizontal partitioning also provides manageability; database administrators often require indexes and their underlying tables partitioned identically so as to make common operations such as backup/restore easier. While partitioning is important, incorporating partitioning makes the problem of automating physical design much harder since: (a) The choices of partitioning can strongly interact with choices of indexes and materialized views. (b) A large new space of physical design alternatives must be considered. (c) Manageability requirements impose a new constraint on the problem. In this paper, we present novel techniques for designing a scalable solution to this integrated physical design problem that takes both performance and manageability into account.

In order to avoid inconsistencies and thus unpredictable query results, materialized views and their indexes should be maintained immediately within user transaction just like indexes on ordinary tables. Unfortunately, the smaller a materialized view is, the higher the concurrency contention between queries and updates as well as among concurrent updates. Therefore, we have investigated methods that reduce contention without forcing users to sacrifice serializability and thus predictable application semantics. These methods extend escrow locking with multi-granularity (hierarchical) locking, snapshot transactions, multi-version concurrency control, key range locking, and system transactions, i.e., multiple proven database implementation techniques. The complete design eliminates all contention between pure read transactions and pure update transactions as well as contention among pure update transactions as well as contention among pure update transactions; it enables maximal concurrency of mixed read-write transactions with other transactions; it supports bulk operations such as data import and online index creation; and it provides recovery for transaction, media, and system failures."	#*Transaction support for indexed views. #@Goetz Graefe, Michael J.

One problem with TAX (as with many existing relational DBMSs) is that the semantics of terms in a TAX DB are not taken into account when answering queries. Thus, even though TAX answers queries with 100% precision, the recall of TAX is relatively low. Our TOSS system improves the recall of TAX via the concept of a similarity enhanced ontology (SEO). Intuitively, an ontology is a set of graphs describing relationships (such as isa, partof, etc.) between terms in a DB. An SEO also evaluates how similarities between terms (e.g. \"J. Ullman\", \"Jeff Ullman\", and \"Jeffrey Ullman\") affect ontologies. Finally, we show how the algebra proposed in TAX can be extended to take SEOs into account. The result is a system that provides a much higher answer quality than TAX does alone (quality is defined as the square root of the product of precision and recall). We experimentally evaluate the TOSS system on the DBLP and SIGMOD bibliographic databases and show that TOSS has acceptable performance."	#*TOSS: An Extension of TAX with Ontologies and Similarity Queries. #@Edward Hung, Yu Deng, V.

SINA is designed with two goals in mind: (1) Scalability in terms of the number of concurrent continuous spatio-temporal queries, and (2) Incremental evaluation of continyous spatio-temporal queries. SINA achieves scalability by empolying a shared execution paradigm where the execution of continuous spatio-temporal queries is abstracted as a spatial join between a set of moving objects and a set of moving queries. Incremental evaluation is achived by computing only the updates of the previously reported answer. We introduce two types of updaes, namely positive and negative updates. Positive or negative updates indicate that a certain object should be added to or removed from the previously reported answer, respectively. SINA manages the computation of postive and negative updates via three phases: the hashing phase, the invalidation phase, and the joining phase. the hashing phase employs an in-memory hash-based join algorithm that results in a set a positive upldates. The invalidation phase is triggered every T seconds or when the memory is fully occupied to produce a set of negative updates. Finally, the joining phase is triggered by the end of the invalidation phase to produce a set of both positive and negative updates that result from joining in-memory data with in-disk data. Experimental results show that SINA is scalable and is more efficient than other index-based spatio-temporal algorithms."	#*SINA: Scalable Incremental Processing of Continuous Queries in Spatio-temporal Databases. #@Mohamed F.

First, we motivate and introduce a novel class of data mining problems that arise in labeling a group of mass spectra, specifically for analysis of atmospheric aerosols, but with natural applications to market-basket datasets. This builds upon other recent work in which we introduced the problem of labeling a single spectrum, and is motivated by the advent of a new generation of Aerosol Time-of-Flight Spectrometers, which are capable of generating mass spectra for hundreds of aerosol particles per minute. We also describe two algorithms for group labeling, which differ greatly in how they utilize a linear programming (LP) solver, and also differ greatly from algorithms for labeling a single spectrum.Our second contribution is to show how to automatically select between these two algorithms in a cost-based manner, analogous to how a query optimizer selects from a space of query plans. While the details are specific to the labeling problem, we believe that is a promising first step towards a general framework for cost-based data mining, and opens up an important direction for future search."	#*Cost-Based Labeling of Groups of Mass Spectra. #@Lei Chen 0003, Zheng Huang, Raghu Ramakrishnan #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99ad0b7602d97023502b2 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9a114b7602d9702a02b45 #%53e9a839b7602d970318501b #%53e9b403b7602d9703ef50a9 #%53e9a863b7602d97031acd07 #%53e997b2b7602d9701f91207 #%53e9acdbb7602d97036ba61f #%53e9a0e6b7602d97029d2721 #%53e99809b7602d9702020cce #%53e9af3ab7602d9703978384 #%53e9b954b7602d970453d01f

Aggregate values over such data thus depend on the observing location, where the weight given to each item depends on its distance from that location. We term such aggregation spatially-decaying.Spatially-decaying aggregation has numerous applications: Individual sensor nodes collect readings of an environmental parameter such as contamination level or parking spot availability; the nodes then communicate to integrate their readings so that each location obtains contamination level or parking availability in its neighborhood. Nodes in a p2p network could use a summary of content and properties of nodes in their neighborhood in order to guide search. In graphical databases such as Web hyperlink structure, properties such as subject of pages that can reach or be reached from a page using link traversals provide information on the page.We formalize the notion of spatially-decaying aggregation and develop efficient algorithms for fundamental aggregation functions, including sums and averages, random sampling, heavy hitters, quantiles, and Lp norms."	#*Spatially-decaying aggregation over a network: model and algorithms. #@Edith Cohen, Haim Kaplan #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b4a5b7602d9703fb482d #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e99a0fb7602d97022625a7 #%53e99960b7602d97021a5260 #%53e9a533b7602d9702e58b57 #%53e9abb1b7602d970355bf0d #%53e9b791b7602d970433ab63 #%53e9b607b7602d970415da68 #%53e9b91eb7602d9704502f27 #%53e9a360b7602d9702c6dde2 #%53e9b7cdb7602d970437d43e #%53e9b01db7602d9703a7ab27 #%53e99d73b7602d970262b64e #%53e9b9fbb7602d97045f637d #%53e9bd04b7602d970498b9ee #%53e99e71b7602d9702732b0a #%53e9a9d3b7602d970333421c #%53e9b9a0b7602d9704592970

The performance and scalability of the matching algorithm is essential for the system when the number of XPath subscriptions is large. Earlier solutions to this problem usually built large finite state automata for all the XPath subscriptions in memory. The scalability of this approach is limited by the amount of available physical memory. In this paper, we propose an implementation that uses a relational database as the matching engine. The heavy lifting part of evaluating a large number of subscriptions is done inside a relational database using indices and joins. We described several different implementation strategies and presented a performance evaluation. The system shows very good performance and scalability in our experiments, handling millions of subscriptions with moderate amount of physical memory."	#*Implementing a Scalable XML Publish/Subscribe System Using a Relational Database System. #@Feng Tian, Berthold Reinwald, Hamid Pirahesh, Tobias Mayr, Jussi Myllymaki #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a0adb7602d9702997364 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56

This paper introduces a novel paradigm for specifying XML security constraints and investigates the enforcement of such constraints during XML query evaluation. Our approach is based on the novel concept of security views, which provide for each user group (a) an XML view consisting of all and only the information that the users are authorized to access, and (b) a view DTD that the XML view conforms to. Security views effectively protect sensitive data from access and potential inferences by unauthorized user, and provide authorized users with necessary schema information to facilitate effective query formulation and optimization. We propose an efficient algorithm for deriving security view definitions from security policies (defined on the original document DTD) for different user groups. We also develop novel algorithms for XPath query rewriting and optimization such that queries over security views can be efficiently answered without materializing the views. Our algorithms transform a query over a security view to an equivalent query over the original document, and effectively prune query nodes by exploiting the structural properties of the document DTD in conjunction with approximate XPath containment tests. Our work is the first to study a flexible, DTD-based access-control model for XML and its implications on the XML query-execution engine. Furthermore, it is among the first efforts for query rewriting and optimization in the presence of general DTDs for a rich a class of XPath queries. An empirical study based on real-life DTDs verifies the effectiveness of our approach."	#*Secure XML Querying with Security Views. #@Wenfei Fan, Chee Yong Chan, Minos N.

When computational resources are sufficient, we propose that the goal of optimization should be to find an execution plan that minimizes resource usage within the available resource constraints. When resources are insufficient, on the other hand, we propose that the goal should be to find an execution plan that sheds some of the input load (by randomly dropping tuples) to keep resource usage within bounds while maximizing the output rate. An intuitive approach to load shedding suggests starting with the plan that would be optimal if resources were sufficient and adding \"drop boxes\" to this plan. We find this to be often times suboptimal - in many instances the optimal partial answer plan results from adding drop boxes to plans that are not optimal in the unlimited resource case. In view of this, we use our framework to investigate an approach to optimization that unifies the placement of drop boxes and the choice of the query plan from which to drop tuples. The effectiveness of our optimizer is experimentally validated and the results show the promise of this approach."	#*Static Optimization of Conjunctive Queries with Sliding Windows Over Infinite Streams. #@Ahmed Ayad, Jeffrey F.

In fact, all cells in nature carry carbohydrate sugar chains, or glycans, that help modulate various cell-cell events for the development of the organism. Unfortunately, informatics research on glycans has been slow in comparison to DNA and proteins, largely due to difficulties in the biological analysis of glycan structures. Our work consists of data engineering approaches in order to glean some understanding of the current glycan data that is publicly available. In particular, by modeling glycans as labeled unordered trees, we have implemented a tree-matching algorithm for measuring tree similarity. Our algorithm utilizes proven efficient methodologies in computer science that has been extended and developed for glycan data. Moreover, since glycans are recognized by various agents in multicellular organisms, in order to capture the patterns that might be recognized, we needed to somehow capture the dependencies that seem to range beyond the directly connected nodes in a tree. Therefore, by defining glycans as labeled ordered trees, we were able to develop a new probabilistic tree model such that sibling patterns across a tree could be mined. We provide promising results from our methodologies that could prove useful for the future of glycome informatics."	#*Managing and Analyzing Carbohydrate Data. #@Kiyoko F.

We introduce CORDS, an efficient and scalable tool for automatic discovery of correlations and soft functional dependencies between columns. CORDS searches for column pairs that might have interesting and useful dependency relations by systematically enumerating candidate pairs and simultaneously pruning unpromising candidates using a flexible set of heuristics. A robust chi-squared analysis is applied to a sample of column values in order to identify correlations, and the number of distinct values in the sampled columns is analyzed to detect soft functional dependencies. CORDS can be used as a data mining tool, producing dependency graphs that are of intrinsic interest. We focus primarily on the use of CORDS in query optimization. Specifically, CORDS recommends groups of columns on which to maintain certain simple joint statistics. These \"column-group\" statistics are then used by the optimizer to avoid naive selectivity estimates based on inappropriate independence assumptions. This approach, because of its simplicity and judicious use of sampling, is relatively easy to implement in existing commercial systems, has very low overhead, and scales well to the large numbers of columns and large table sizes found in real-world databases. Experiments with a prototype implementation show that the use of CORDS in query optimization can speed up query execution times by an order of magnitude. CORDS can be used in tandem with query feedback systems such as the LEO learning optimizer, leveraging the infrastructure of such systems to correct bad selectivity estimates and ameliorating the poor performance of feedback systems during slow learning phases."	#*CORDS: Automatic Discovery of Correlations and Soft Functional Dependencies. #@Ihab F.

Indeed, the EDBT Association (a Europe-based non-profit organization also known as the EDBT Endowment) has the purpose of promoting and supporting the progress and the study of the database technology and application. Its two major initiatives are the EDBT Conference (International Conference on Extending Data Base Technology), held every two years since 1988, and the EDBT Summer School, held almost with the same regularity, since 1991. Previous schools took place in Alghero (Italy) in 1991, Leysin (Switzerland) in 1993, Gubbio (Italy) in 1995, Capri (Italy) in 1997, La Baule (France) in 1999, and Cargèese (France) in 2002.

A fundamental challenge in many DSMS applications (e.g., network monitoring, financial monitoring over stock tickers, sensor processing) is that conditions may vary significantly over time. Since queries in these systems are usually long-running, or continuous [4], it is important to consider adaptive approaches to query processing. Without adaptivity, performance may drop drastically as stream data and arrival characteristics, query loads, and system conditions change over time.StreaMon uses several techniques to support adaptive query processing [1, 2, 3]; we demonstrate three of them:•Reducing run-time memory requirements for continuous queries by exploiting stream data and arrival patterns.•Adaptive join ordering for pipelined multiway stream joins, with strong quality guarantees.•Placing subresult caches adaptively in pipelined multiway stream joins to avoid recomputation of intermediate results."	#*StreaMon: An Adaptive Engine for Stream Query Processing. #@Shivnath Babu, Jennifer Widom #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b091b7602d9703afbc94 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e99b0ab7602d970239bda1 #%53e9b500b7602d970402f387

Information content (or redundancy) is measured with respect to a prescribed model for the data, a model that is often expressed as a set of constraints. In this work, we consider the problem of doing data redesign in an environment where the prescribed model is unknown or incomplete. Specifically, we consider the problem of finding structural clues in an instance of data, an instance which may contain errors, missing values, and duplicate records. We propose a set of information-theoretic tools for finding structural summaries that are useful in characterizing the information content of the data, and ultimately useful in data design. We provide algorithms for creating these summaries over large, categorical data sets. We study the use of these summaries in one specific physical design task, that of ranking functional dependencies based on their data redundancy. We show how our ranking can be used by a physical data-design tool to find good vertical decompositions of a relation (decompositions that improve the information content of the design). We present an evaluation of the approach on real data sets."	#*Information-Theoretic Tools for Mining Database Structure from Large Data Sets. #@Periklis Andritsos, Renée J.

We first develop analytical models to estimate information overload faced by a user for a given exploration. Based on those models, we formulate the categorization problem as a cost optimization problem and develop heuristic algorithms to compute the min-cost categorization."	#*Automatic Categorization of Query Results. #@Kaushik Chakrabarti, Surajit Chaudhuri, Seung-won Hwang #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9ab13b7602d970349777a #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9bcf6b7602d970497fa3f #%53e9a455b7602d9702d73c2b #%53e9a495b7602d9702db643d #%53e9a97ab7602d97032d1968 #%53e99845b7602d9702073c2e #%53e9af13b7602d970394ce72 #%53e9ae17b7602d9703825532 #%53e9bc80b7602d970490276f #%53e9aadfb7602d970345ce1b #%53e9b4b4b7602d9703fccc99

The database selection task relies on statistical summaries of the database contents, which are not typically exported by databases. Previous research has developed algorithms for constructing an approximate content summary of a text database from a small document sample extracted via querying. Unfortunately, Zipf's law practically guarantees that content summaries built this way for any relatively large database will fail to cover many low-frequency words. Incomplete content summaries might negatively affect the database selection process, especially for short queries with infrequent words. To improve the coverage of approximate content summaries, we build on the observation that topically similar databases tend to have related vocabularies. Therefore, the approximate content summaries of topically related databases can complement each other and increase their coverage. Specifically, we exploit a (given or derived) hierarchical categorization of the databases and adapt the notion of \"shrinkage\" -a form of smoothing that has been used successfully for document classification-to the content summary construction task. A thorough evaluation over 315 real web databases as well as over TREC data suggests that the shrinkage-based content summaries are substantially more complete than their \"unshrunk\" counterparts. We also describe how to modify existing database selection algorithms to adaptively decide -at run-time-whether to apply shrinkage for a query. Our experiments, which rely on TREC data sets, queries, and the associated \"relevance judgments,\" show that our shrinkage-based approach significantly improves state-of-the-art database selection algorithms, and also outperforms a recently proposed hierarchical strategy that exploits database classification as well."	#*When one Sample is not Enough: Improving Text Database Selection Using Shrinkage. #@Panagiotis G.

For example, log streams from call centers belong to different call sessions and call sessions consist of services' sub-sessions. We may want to monitor statistics and perform accounting at any level on this hierarchy, relative to any other higher level (e.g. monitoring the average service session per call vs. the average service session for the entire system.) We argue that data streams of this kind have rich procedural semantics - i.e. behavior - and therefore a semantically rich model should be used: a session may be defined by opening and closing conditions, may have data and methods and may consist of sub-sessions. We propose a simple conceptual model based on the notion of \"session\" - similar to a class in an object-oriented environment -- having lifetime semantics. Queries on top of this schema can be formulated via HSA (hierarchical stream aggregate) expressions. We describe an algorithm dictating how stream data flow down session hierarchies and discuss potential evaluation and optimization techniques for HSAs. Finally we introduce NESTREAM, a prototype implementation for these ideas and give some preliminary experimental results."	#*NESTREAM: Querying Nested Streams. #@Damianos Chatziantoniou, Achilleas Anagnostopoulos #t2004 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e99a78b7602d97022e901f #%53e9aa95b7602d970340deab #%53e9b607b7602d970415da68 #%53e9ac22b7602d97035e6a11 #%53e9a8ffb7602d9703251ecc #%53e9b46fb7602d9703f6fc8e #%53e9ba28b7602d9704632924 #%53e9a30fb7602d9702c1854d #%53e9acfeb7602d97036df583 #%53e997e4b7602d9701fdbae1

Support for such any-device, any-application computing paradigm requires the ability to store and manage data in a generic representation and to transform it for usage in different applications, which may also be running on different platforms.

The schemas can be any combination of relational or XML schemas, and can be independently designed. In addition to the source-to-target mappings, we consider as part of the mapping scenario a set of target constraints specifying additional properties on the target schema. This becomes particularly important when integrating data from multiple data sources with overlapping data and when such constraints can express data merging rules at the target. We define the semantics of query answering in such an integration scenario, and design two novel algorithms, basic query rewrite and query resolution, to implement the semantics. The basic query rewrite algorithm reformulates target queries in terms of the source schemas, based on the mappings. The query resolution algorithm generates additional rewritings that merge related information from multiple sources and assemble a coherent view of the data, by incorporating target constraints. The algorithms are implemented and then evaluated using a comprehensive set of experiments based on both synthetic and real-life data integration scenarios."	#*Constraint-Based XML Query Rewriting For Data Integration. #@Cong Yu, Lucian Popa #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9a19bb7602d9702a9189c #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9988cb7602d97020c9094 #%53e9a113b7602d9702a00788 #%53e9ab73b7602d97035173c8 #%53e9bcb3b7602d970493311c #%53e9b6fab7602d970428ec94 #%53e9ae43b7602d970385cbdb #%53e9b8a1b7602d970447a095 #%53e9ab89b7602d9703535e2f #%53e9bcd9b7602d970495fadd #%53e9aa24b7602d970339238d #%53e9aab0b7602d970342d58b #%53e9b4d4b7602d9703ff2ce5 #%53e9b043b7602d9703aa51b4 #%53e9aee4b7602d9703911d2a #%53e9b49bb7602d9703fa5ee9 #%53e9af99b7602d97039e5318 #%53e99931b7602d97021700d9 #%53e9a609b7602d9702f35f7e #%53e99ffcb7602d97028e082c #%53e9b2f0b7602d9703daee71 #%53e9a825b7602d970316fa4c

Annotation using terms from ontologies provides reliable computational access to data. The Gene Ontology (GO), a structured controlled vocabulary of nearly 17,000 terms, is becoming the de facto standard for describing the functionality of gene products. Many prominent biomedical databases use GO as a source of terms for functional annotation of their gene-product entries to promote consistent querying and interoperability. However, current annotation editors do not constrain the choice of GO terms users may enter for a given gene product, potentially resulting in an inconsistent or even nonsensical description. Furthermore, the process of annotation is largely an unguided one in which the user must wade through large GO subtrees in search of terms. Relying upon a reasoner loaded with a DAML+OIL version of GO and an instance store of mined GO-term-to-GO-term associations, GOAT aims to aid the user in the annotation of gene products with GO terms by displaying those field values that are most likely to be appropriate based on previously entered terms. This can result in a reduction in biologically inconsistent combinations of GO terms and a less tedious annotation process on the part of the user."	#*Using Reasoning to Guide Annotation with Gene Ontology Terms in GOAT. #@Michael Bada, Daniele Turi, Robin McEntire, Robert Stevens #t2004 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9bacfb7602d97046fc002 #%53e99946b7602d97021850cf

This in turn can leverage the recently developed technology of structural join algorithms to evaluate the query efficiently. In this paper, we identify a fundamental tension in XML data modeling: (i) data represented as deep trees (which can make effective use of twig patterns) are often un-normalized, leading to update anomalies, while (ii) normalized data tends to be shallow, resulting in heavy use of expensive value-based joins in queries.Our solution to this data modeling problem is a novel multi-colored trees (MCT) logical data model, which is an evolutionary extension of the XML data model, and permits trees with multi-colored nodes to signify their participation in multiple hierarchies. This adds significant semantic structure to individual data nodes. We extend XQuery expressions to navigate between structurally related nodes, taking color into account, and also to create new colored trees as restructurings of an MCT database. While MCT serves as a significant evolutionary extension to XML as a logical data model, one of the key roles of XML is for information exchange. To enable exchange of MCT information, we develop algorithms for optimally serializing an MCT database as XML. We discuss alternative physical representations for MCT databases, using relational and native XML databases, and describe an implementation on top of the Timber native XML database. Experimental evaluation, using our prototype implementation, shows that not only are MCT queries/updates more succinct and easier to express than equivalent shallow tree XML queries, but they can also be significantly more efficient to evaluate than equivalent deep and shallow tree XML queries/updates."	#*Colorful XML: One Hierarchy Isn't Enough. #@H.

In order to fully exploit its enormous potential as a global repository of information, we need to understand how its size, topology, and content are evolving. This then allows the development of new techniques for locating and retrieving information that are better able to adapt and scale to its change and growth. The web's users are highly diverse and can access the it from a variety of devices and interfaces, at different places and times, and for varying purposes. Thus, new techniques are being developed for personalising the presentation and content of web-based information depending on how it is being accessed and on the individual user's requirements and preferences. New applications in areas such as e-business, sensor networks, and mobile and ubiquitous computing need to be able to detect and react quickly to events and changes in web-based information. Traditional approaches using query-based `pull' of information to find out if events or changes of interest have occurred may not be able to scale to the quantity and frequency of events and changes being generated, and new `push'-based techniques are being deployed in which information producers automatically notify consumers when events or changes of interest to them occur. Semantic Web and Web Service technologies are being developed and adopted, with the aim of providing standard ways for web-based applications to share and personalise information."	#*Report on the 3rd Web Dynamics Workshop, at WWW'2004. #@Mark Levene, Alexandra Poulovassilis #t2004 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e99938b7602d9702178a2d #%53e997bab7602d9701fa2515

Association rules have been proved to be useful in analyzing such datasets. However, most existing association rule mining algorithms are unable to efficiently handle datasets with large number of columns. Moreover, the number of association rules generated from such datasets is enormous due to the large number of possible column combinations.In this paper, we describe a new algorithm called FARMER that is specially designed to discover association rules from microarray datasets. Instead of finding individual association rules, FARMER finds interesting rule groups which are essentially a set of rules that are generated from the same set of rows. Unlike conventional rule mining algorithms, FARMER searches for interesting rules in the row enumeration space and exploits all user-specified constraints including minimum support, confidence and chi-square to support efficient pruning. Several experiments on real bioinformatics datasets show that FARMER is orders of magnitude faster than previous association rule mining algorithms."	#*FARMER: Finding Interesting Rule Groups in Microarray Datasets. #@Gao Cong, Anthony K.

Pipelined filters are common in stream applications and capture a large class of multiway stream joins. We focus on the problem of ordering the filters adaptively to minimize processing cost in an environment where stream and filter characteristics vary unpredictably over time. Our core algorithm, A-Greedy (for Adaptive Greedy), has strong theoretical guarantees: If stream and filter characteristics were to stabilize, A-Greedy would converge to an ordering within a small constant factor of optimal. (In experiments A-Greedy usually converges to the optimal ordering.) One very important feature of A-Greedy is that it monitors and responds to selectivities that are correlated across filters (i.e., that are nonindependent), which provides the strong quality guarantee but incurs run-time overhead. We identify a three-way tradeoff among provable convergence to good orderings, run-time overhead, and speed of adaptivity. We develop a suite of variants of A-Greedy that lie at different points on this tradeoff spectrum. We have implemented all our algorithms in the STREAM prototype Data Stream Management System and a thorough performance evaluation is presented."	#*Adaptive Ordering of Pipelined Stream Filters. #@Shivnath Babu, Rajeev Motwani, Kamesh Munagala, Itaru Nishizawa, Jennifer Widom #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99b0ab7602d970239bda1 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9a658b7602d9702f8c2b2 #%53e9a42cb7602d9702d4a1f4 #%53e9a0fbb7602d97029e6ee7 #%53e9b30ab7602d9703dd20e6 #%53e9aa57b7602d97033c7c24 #%53e9afbab7602d9703a0a1aa #%53e9b8eeb7602d97044d2872 #%53e9acfeb7602d97036df583 #%53e9a515b7602d9702e350a0 #%53e9ae76b7602d9703895066 #%53e9b500b7602d970402f387 #%53e9a178b7602d9702a6c09d

SI avoids many concurrency errors, and it never delays read-only transactions. However it does not guarantee serializability. It has been widely assumed that, under SI, read-only transactions always execute serializably provided the concurrent update transactions are serializable. The reason for this is that all SI reads return values from a single instant of time when all committed transactions have completed their writes and no writes of non-committed transactions are visible. This seems to imply that read-only transactions will not read anomalous results so long as the update transactions with which they execute do not write such results. In the current note, however, we exhibit an example contradicting these assumptions: it is possible for an SI history to be non-serializable while the sub-history containing all update transactions is serializable."	#*A Read-Only Transaction Anomaly Under Snapshot Isolation. #@Alan Fekete, Elizabeth J.

Exploratory analysis of data may not require exact answers to queries, however: results based on sampling the data are often satisfactory. Supporting sampling as a primitive SQL operator turns out to be difficult because sampling does not commute with many SQL operators.In this paper, we describe an implementation in IBM® DB2® Universal Database (UDB) of a sampling operator that commutes with some SQL operators. As a result, the query with the sampling operator always returns a random sample of the answers and in many cases runs faster than it would have without such an operator."	#*Query Sampling in DB2 Universal Database. #@Jarek Gryz, Junjie Guo, Linqi Liu, Calisto Zuzarte #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b31bb7602d9703de35ca #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9bc7fb7602d97048fd265 #%53e9b259b7602d9703cfe5e9 #%53e9afe1b7602d9703a384b8 #%53e9acefb7602d97036cc724 #%53e9b11db7602d9703b996bc #%53e9a84eb7602d9703199d62 #%53e9b421b7602d9703f1a155 #%53e9b53cb7602d970407580f #%53e9a825b7602d970316ced4

These broadly consist of graph traversal approaches, optimized with auxiliary structures known as structure indexes; and approaches based on information-retrieval style inverted lists. We propose a strategy that combines the two forms of auxiliary indexes, and a query evaluation algorithm for branching path expressions based on this strategy. Our technique is general and applicable for a wide range of choices of structure indexes and inverted list join algorithms. Our experiments over the Niagara XML DBMS show the benefit of integrating the two forms of indexes. We also consider algorithmic issues in evaluating path expression queries when the notion of relevance ranking is incorporated. By integrating the above techniques with the Threshold Algorithm proposed by Fagin et al., we obtain instance optimal algorithms to push down top k computation."	#*On the Integration of Structure Indexes and Inverted Lists. #@Raghav Kaushik, Rajasekar Krishnamurthy, Jeffrey F.

In this paper, we develop principled approaches to overcome this limitation of block-level sampling for histograms as well as distinct-value estimations. For histogram construction, we give a novel two-phase adaptive method in which the sample size required to reach a desired accuracy is decided based on a first phase sample. This method is significantly faster than previous iterative methods proposed for the same problem. For distinct-value estimation, we show that existing estimators designed for uniform-random samples may perform very poorly if used directly on block-level samples. We present a key technique that computes an appropriate subset of a block-level sample that is suitable for use with most existing estimators. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the first principled method for distinct-value estimation with block-level samples. We provide extensive experimental results validating our methods."	#*Effective Use of Block-Level Sampling in Statistics Estimation. #@Surajit Chaudhuri, Gautam Das, Utkarsh Srivastava #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b03db7602d9703a9bd2e #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9a29db7602d9702ba4e51 #%53e9a863b7602d97031b0957 #%53e99fd0b7602d97028a969e #%53e9ae48b7602d970385cf97

Current tools that allow applications to programmatically extract this information rely heavily on user input, often in the form of labeled extracted records. The sheer size and rate of growth of the Web make any solution that relies primarily on user input is infeasible in the long term. Fortunately, many Web sites contain much explicit and implicit structure, both in layout and content, that we can exploit for the purpose of information extraction. This paper describes an approach to automatic extraction and segmentation of records from Web tables. Automatic methods do not require any user input, but rely solely on the layout and content of the Web source. Our approach relies on the common structure of many Web sites, which present information as a list or a table, with a link in each entry leading to a detail page containing additional information about that item. We describe two algorithms that use redundancies in the content of table and detail pages to aid in information extraction. The first algorithm encodes additional information provided by detail pages as constraints and finds the segmentation by solving a constraint satisfaction problem. The second algorithm uses probabilistic inference to find the record segmentation. We show how each approach can exploit the web site structure in a general, domain-independent manner, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of each algorithm on a set of twelve Web sites."	#*Using the Structure of Web Sites for Automatic Segmentation of Tables. #@Kristina Lerman, Lise Getoor, Steven Minton, Craig A.

Applications are written with some understanding of which queries can use data that is not entirely current and which copies are \"good enough\"; however, there are neither explicit requirements nor guarantees. We propose to make this knowledge available to the DBMS through explicit currency and consistency (C&C) constraints in queries and develop techniques so the DBMS can guarantee that the constraints are satisfied. In this paper we describe our model for expressing C&C constraints, define their semantics, and propose SQL syntax. We explain how C&C constraints are enforced in MTCache, our prototype mid-tier database cache, including how constraints and replica update policies are elegantly integrated into the cost-based query optimizer. Consistency constraints are enforced at compile time while currency constraints are enforced at run time by dynamic plans that check the currency of each local replica before use and select sub-plans accordingly. This approach makes optimal use of the cache DBMS while at the same time guaranteeing that applications always get data that is \"good enough\" for their purpose."

Data summarizations (e.g., data bubbles) have been proposed to compress very large static databases into representative points suitable for subsequent effective hierarchical cluster analysis. In many real world applications, however, the databases dynamically change due to frequent insertions and deletions, possibly changing the data distribution and clustering structure over time. Completely reapplying both the data summarization and the clustering algorithm to detect the changes in the clustering structure and update the uncovered data patterns following such deletions and insertions is prohibitively expensive for large fast changing databases. In this paper, we propose a new scheme to maintain data bubbles incrementally. By using incremental data bubbles, a high-quality hierarchical clustering is quickly available at any point in time. In our scheme, a quality measure for incremental data bubbles is used to identify data bubbles that do not compress well their underlying data points after certain insertions and deletions. Only these data bubbles are re-built using efficient split and merge operations. An extensive experimental evaluation shows that the incremental data bubbles provide significantly faster data summarization than completely re-building the data bubbles after a certain number of insertions and deletions, and are effective in preserving (and in some cases even improving) the quality of the data summarization."	#*Incremental and Effective Data Summarization for Dynamic Hierarchical Clustering. #@Samer Nassar, Jörg Sander, Corrine Cheng #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b45eb7602d9703f5ce0d #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9aefcb7602d970392fd49 #%53e9a208b7602d9702b0b9ae #%53e9adc7b7602d97037d02be #%53e9a4f2b7602d9702e12321 #%53e9bd18b7602d97049a135a #%53e9b360b7602d9703e3f35e #%53e99f5cb7602d970282bd5d #%53e99876b7602d97020af5d1 #%53e9a49cb7602d9702db9ae9 #%53e99b9bb7602d9702445abb #%53e9a85cb7602d97031a708b #%53e999adb7602d97021ef179

Inevitably, this will result in the development of on-line decision support systems, where users and analysts interactively explore large XML data sets through a declarative query interface (e.g., XQuery or XSLT). Given the importance of remaining interactive, such on-line systems can employ approximate query answers as an effective mechanism for reducing response time and providing users with early feedback. This approach has been successfully used in relational systems and it becomes even more compelling in the XML world, where the evaluation of complex queries over massive tree-structured data is inherently more expensive.In this paper, we initiate a study of approximate query answering techniques for large XML databases. Our approach is based on a novel, conceptually simple, yet very effective XML-summarization mechanism: TREESKETCH synopses. We demonstrate that, unlike earlier techniques focusing solely on selectivity estimation, our TREESKETCH synopses are much more effective in capturing the complete tree structure of the underlying XML database. We propose novel construction algorithms for building TREESKETCH summaries of limited size, and describe schemes for processing general XML twig queries over a concise TREESKETCH in order to produce very fast, approximate tree-structured query answers. To quantify the quality of such approximate answers, we propose a novel, intuitive error metric that captures the quality of the approximation in terms of both the overall structure of the XML tree and the distribution of document edges. Experimental results on real-life and synthetic data sets verify the effectiveness of our TREESKETCH synopses in producing fast, accurate approximate answers and demonstrate their benefits over previously proposed techniques that focus solely on selectivity estimation. In particular, TREESKETCHes yield faster, more accurate approximate answers and selectivity estimates, and are more efficient to construct. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to address the timely problem of producing fast, approximate tree-structured answers for complex XML queries."	#*Approximate XML Query Answers. #@Neoklis Polyzotis, Minos N.

The tremendous amount of information gathered from genomics will be dwarfed in the next decade by the knowledge to be gained from comprehensive, systematic studies of the properties and behaviors of all proteins and other biomolecules. High-resolution imaging of molecules and cells will be critical for understanding complex systems such as the nervous system, whether it be for the localization of specific neuron types within a region of the central nervous system, the branching pattern of dendritic trees, or the localization of molecules at the subcellular level. Furthermore, knowing how these distribution patterns and subcellular locations change as a function of time is critical to understanding how cells respond to stress, injury, aging, and disease. We are developing sophisticated information technologies for collecting and interpreting the enormous volume of biological image data. A major outcome of the research will be a unique, fully operational, distributed digital library of biomolecular image data accessible to researchers around the world.

However, most current research involving sampling considers the problem of how to use a sample, and not how to compute one. The implicit assumption is that a \"sample\" is a small data structure that is easily maintained as new data are encountered, even though simple statistical arguments demonstrate that very large samples of gigabytes or terabytes in size can be necessary to provide high accuracy. No existing work tackles the problem of maintaining very large, disk-based samples from a data management perspective, and no techniques now exist for maintaining very large samples in an online manner from streaming data. In this paper, we present online algorithms for maintaining on-disk samples that are gigabytes or terabytes in size.

Twig query matching has been identified as a core operation in querying tree-structured XML data. A number of algorithms have been proposed recently to process a twig query holistically. Those algorithms, however, only deal with twig queries without OR-predicates. A straightforward approach that first decomposes a twig query with OR-predicates into multiple twig queries without OR-predicates and then combines their results is obviously not optimal in most cases. In this paper, we study novel holistic-processing algorithms for twig queries with OR-predicates without decomposition. In particular, we present a merge-based algorithm for sorted XML data and an index-based algorithm for indexed XML data. We show that holistic processing is much more efficient than the decomposition approach. Furthermore, we show that using indexes can significantly improve the performance for matching twig queries with OR-predicates, especially when the queries have large inputs but relatively small outputs."	#*Efficient Processing of Twig Queries with OR-Predicates. #@Haifeng Jiang, Hongjun Lu, Wei Wang 0011 #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b6eeb7602d9704284661 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56

For a domain of interest, there often exist many such sources with varied coverage or querying capabilities. As an important step to the integration of these sources, we consider the integration of their query interfaces. More specifically, we focus on the crucial step of the integration: accurately matching the interfaces. While the integration of query interfaces has received more attentions recently, current approaches are not sufficiently general: (a) they all model interfaces with flat schemas; (b) most of them only consider 1:1 mappings of fields over the interfaces; (c) they all perform the integration in a blackbox-like fashion and the whole process has to be restarted from scratch if anything goes wrong; and (d) they often require laborious parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose an interactive, clustering-based approach to matching query interfaces. The hierarchical nature of interfaces is captured with ordered trees. Varied types of complex mappings of fields are examined and several approaches are proposed to effectively identify these mappings. We put the human integrator back in the loop and propose several novel approaches to the interactive learning of parameters and the resolution of uncertain mappings. Extensive experiments are conducted and results show that our approach is highly effective."	#*An Interactive Clustering-based Approach to Integrating Source Query interfaces on the Deep Web. #@Wensheng Wu, Clement T.

In a PDMS, every peer is associated with a schema that represents the peer's domain of interest, and semantic relationships between peers are provided locally between pairs (or small sets) of peers. By traversing semantic paths of mappings, a query over one peer can obtain relevant data from any reachable peer in the network. Semantic paths are traversed by reformulating queries at a peer into queries on its neighbors.Naively following semantic paths is highly inefficient in practice. We describe several techniques for optimizing the reformulation process in a PDMS and validate their effectiveness using real-life data sets. In particular, we develop techniques for pruning paths in the reformulation process and for minimizing the reformulated queries as they are created. In addition, we consider the effect of the strategy we use to search through the space of reformulations. Finally, we show that pre-computing semantic paths in a PDMS can greatly improve the efficiency of the reformulation process. Together, all of these techniques form a basis for scalable query reformulation in PDMS.To enable our optimizations, we developed practical algorithms, of independent interest, for checking containment and minimization of XML queries, and for composing XML mappings."	#*Efficient Query Reformulation in Peer-Data Management Systems. #@Igor Tatarinov, Alon Y.

XSeq is a powerful XML indexing infrastructure which makes tree patterns a first class citizen in XML query processing. Unlike most indexing methods that directly manipulate tree structures, XSeq builds its indexing infrastructure on a much simpler data model: sequences. That is, we represent both XML data and XML queries by structure-encoded sequences. We have shown that this new data representation preserves query equivalence, and more importantly, through subsequence matching, structured queries can be answered directly without resorting to expensive join operations. Moreover, the XSeq infrastructure unifies indices on both the content and the structure of XML documents, hence it achieves an additional performance advantage over methods indexing either just content or structure, or indexing them separately."	#*XSeq: An Index Infrastructure for Tree Pattern Queries. #@Xiaofeng Meng, Yu Jiang, Yan Chen, Haixun Wang #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b042b7602d9703aa139e #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9a051b7602d9702937b84 #%53e9a58bb7602d9702eb23b4 #%53e9a02db7602d9702914e87 #%53e9a812b7602d9703157a36

The symposium, which was colocated with the IEEE International Workshop on Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks (POLICY 2004), continues its tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of access control and related technologies, including models, systems, applications, and theory. SACMAT gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of access control. The call for papers attracted 65 submissions, from all over the world. The program committee selected 18 papers for presentation. The 18 papers, organized in seven sessions, were presented over two and an half days. The selected papers cover a wide range of topics, ranging from next generation access control models, to security analysis, role administration, policy specification and implementation, and access control for distributed environments and XML data. All the accepted papers were included in a volume published by ACM, whereas best papers from the symposium have been invited for possible publication in ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC). Besides the technical sessions, this year program included a keynote speech on Access Control for Databases, and a panel on Security for Grid-based Computing Systems."	#*Report on the 9th ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies (SACMMAT'04). #@Elena Ferrari #t2004 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9b1d1b7602d9703c6192a

In our model, only certain segments in the databases called 'piers' need to be accessed during searches as opposite to other approaches which require a full scan on the biological sequence database. To further improve the search efficiency, the piers are stored in a specially designed hash table which helps to avoid expensive alignment operation. The has table is small enough to reside in main memory, hence avoiding I/O in the search steps. We show theoretically and empirically that the proposed approach can efficiently detect biological sequences that are similar to a query sequence with very high sensitivity."	#*Piers: An Efficient Model for Similarity Search in DNA Sequence Databases. #@Xia Cao, Shuai Cheng Li, Beng Chin Ooi, Anthony K.

AXML documents are XML documents whose content is given partly extensionally, by explicit data elements, and partly intensionally, by embedded calls to Web services, which can be invoked to generate data.A major challenge in the efficient evaluation of queries over such documents is to detect which calls may bring data that is relevant for the query execution, and to avoid the materialization of irrelevant information. The problem is intricate, as service calls may be embedded anywhere in the document, and service invocations possibly return data containing calls to new services. Hence, the detection of relevant calls becomes a continuous process. Also, a good analysis must take the service signatures into consideration.We formalize the problem, and provide algorithms to solve it. We also present an implementation that is compliant with XML and Web services standards, and is used as part of the ActiveXML system. Finally, we experimentally measure the performance gains obtained by a careful filtering of the service calls to be triggered."	#*Lazy Query Evaluation for Active XML. #@Serge Abiteboul, Omar Benjelloun, Bogdan Cautis, Ioana Manolescu, Tova Milo, Nicoleta Preda #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99a35b7602d97022963e6 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9a7eab7602d970312ab77 #%53e9b783b7602d970432bbaa #%53e9ad0ab7602d97036e9e8d #%53e9bb23b7602d970475d139 #%53e9b430b7602d9703f29976 #%53e9b7adb7602d97043554b1 #%53e9ab6fb7602d9703510c05 #%53e9aee4b7602d9703911d2a #%53e9b58eb7602d97040d3ec2 #%53e99931b7602d97021700d9 #%53e99946b7602d97021837b5 #%53e9b8ccb7602d97044aba70 #%53e99827b7602d970204c09c #%53e99894b7602d97020d08a1 #%53e9bb01b7602d97047376a9

Using the query logs, we build a time series for each query word or phrase (e.g., 'Thanksgiving' or 'Christmas gifts') where the elements of the time series are the number of times that a query is issued on a day. All of the methods we describe use sequences of this form and can be applied to time series data generally. Our primary goal is the discovery of semantically similar queries and we do so by identifying queries with similar demand patterns. Utilizing the best Fourier coefficients and the energy of the omitted components, we improve upon the state-of-the-art in time-series similarity matching. The extracted sequence features are then organized in an efficient metric tree index structure. We also demonstrate how to efficiently and accurately discover the important periods in a time-series. Finally we propose a simple but effective method for identification of bursts (long or short-term). Using the burst information extracted from a sequence, we are able to efficiently perform 'query-by-burst' on the database of time-series. We conclude the presentation with the description of a tool that uses the described methods, and serves as an interactive exploratory data discovery tool for the MSN query database."	#*Identifying Similarities, Periodicities and Bursts for Online Search Queries. #@Michail Vlachos, Christopher Meek, Zografoula Vagena, Dimitrios Gunopulos #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9af0cb7602d9703940b40 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e9997eb7602d97021be135 #%53e9b179b7602d9703c00991 #%53e99f42b7602d9702810ff0 #%53e9b1a9b7602d9703c33e40 #%53e9acfeb7602d97036ddaf2 #%53e9bdf6b7602d9704aab9e4 #%53e9b917b7602d9704500623 #%53e9a1c9b7602d9702ac3604 #%53e9997eb7602d97021bdae8

Recently, several rank-join query operators have been proposed based on rank aggregation algorithms. Rank-join operators progressively rank the join results while performing the join operation. The new operators have a direct impact on traditional query processing and optimization.We introduce a rank-aware query optimization framework that fully integrates rank-join operators into relational query engines. The framework is based on extending the System R dynamic programming algorithm in both enumeration and pruning. We define ranking as an interesting property that triggers the generation of rank-aware query plans. Unlike traditional join operators, optimizing for rank-join operators depends on estimating the input cardinality of these operators. We introduce a probabilistic model for estimating the input cardinality, and hence the cost of a rank-join operator. To our knowledge, this paper is the first effort in estimating the needed input size for optimal rank aggregation algorithms. Costing ranking plans, although challenging, is key to the full integration of rank-join operators in real-world query processing engines. We experimentally evaluate our framework by modifying the query optimizer of an open-source database management system. The experiments show the validity of our framework and the accuracy of the proposed estimation model."	#*Rank-aware Query Optimization. #@Ihab F. Ilyas, Rahul Shah, Walid G.

This research is very important, but to make the greatest impact, we must go beyond after-the-fact semantic integration among existing systems, to actively guiding semantic choices in new ontologies and systems - e.g., what concepts should be used as descriptive vocabularies for existing data, or as definitions for newly built systems. The goal is to ease data sharing for both new and old systems, to ensure that needed data is actually collected, and to maximize over time the business value of an enterprise's information systems."	#*From semantic integration to semantics management: case studies and a way forward. #@Arnon Rosenthal, Leonard J.

One major research area in stream management seeks to allocate resources (such as network bandwidth and memory) to query plans, either to minimize resource usage under a precision requirement, or to maximize precision of results under resource constraints. To date, many solutions have been proposed; however, most solutions are ad hoc with hard-coded heuristics to generate query plans. In contrast, we perceive stream resource management as fundamentally a filtering problem, in which the objective is to filter out as much data as possible to conserve resources, provided that the precision standards can be met. We select the Kalman Filter as a general and adaptive filtering solution for conserving resources. The Kalman Filter has the ability to adapt to various stream characteristics, sensor noise, and time variance. Furthermore, we realize a significant performance boost by switching from traditional methods of caching static data (which can soon become stale) to our method of caching dynamic procedures that can predict data reliably at the server without the clients' involvement. In this work we focus on minimization of communication overhead for both synthetic and real-world streams. Through examples and empirical studies, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of using the Kalman Filter as a solution for managing trade-offs between precision of results and resources in satisfying stream queries."	#*Adaptive Stream Resource Management Using Kalman Filters. #@Ankur Jain, Edward Y.

A key requirement for indexing methods in this domain is to efficiently support both update and query operations. Previous work on indexing such databases can be broadly divided into categories: indexing the past positions and indexing the future predicted positions. In this paper we focus on an efficient indexing method for indexing the future positions of moving objects.In this paper we propose an indexing method, called STRIPES, which indexes predicted trajectories in a dual transformed space. Trajectories for objects in d-dimensional space become points in a higher-dimensional 2d-space. This dual transformed space is then indexed using a regular hierarchical grid decomposition indexing structure. STRIPES can evaluate a range of queries including time-slice, window, and moving queries. We have carried out extensive experimental evaluation comparing the performance of STRIPES with the best known existing predicted trajectory index (the TPR*-tree), and show that our approach is significantly faster than TPR*-tree for both updates and search queries."	#*STRIPES: An Efficient Index for Predicted Trajectories. #@Jignesh M.

Providing an aggregate view of such data is important to summarize, visualize, and analyze. We develop the aggregate view based on certain hierarchically organized sets of large-valued regions (\"heavy hitters\"). Such Hierarchical Heavy Hitters (HHHs) were previously introduced as a crucial aggregation technique in one dimension. In order to analyze the wider range of data warehousing applications and realistic IP data streams, we generalize this problem to multiple dimensions.We identify and study two variants of HHHs for multi-dimensional data, namely the \"overlap\" and \"split\" cases, depending on how an aggregate computed for a child node in the multi-dimensional hierarchy is propagated to its parent element(s). For data warehousing applications, we present offline algorithms that take multiple passes over the data and produce the exact HHHs. For data stream applications, we present online algorithms that find approximate HHHs in one pass, with provable accuracy guarantees.We show experimentally, using real and synthetic data, that our proposed online algorithms yield outputs which are very similar (virtually identical, in many cases) to their offline counterparts. The lattice property of the product of hierarchical dimensions (\"diamond\") is crucially exploited in our online algorithms to track approximate HHHs using only a small, fixed number of statistics per candidate node, regardless of the number of dimensions."	#*Diamond in the Rough: Finding Hierarchical Heavy Hitters in Multi-Dimensional Data. #@Graham Cormode, Flip Korn, S.

"#*The next database revolution #@Jim Gray #t2004 #cSIGMOD '04 Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data #index5390972920f70186a0dfac85 #!Database system architectures are undergoing revolutionary changes. Most importantly, algorithms and data are being unified by integrating programming languages with the database system. This gives an extensible object-relational system where non-procedural relational operators manipulate object sets. Coupled with this, each DBMS is now a web service. This has huge implications for how we structure applications. DBMSs are now object containers. Queues are the first objects to be added. These queues are the basis for transaction processing and workflow applications. Future workflow systems are likely to be built on this core. Data cubes and online analytic processing are now baked into most DBMSs. Beyond that, DBMSs have a framework for data mining and machine learning algorithms. Decision trees, Bayes nets, clustering, and time series analysis are built in; new algorithms can be added. There is a rebirth of column stores for sparse tables and to optimize bandwidth. Text, temporal, and spatial data access methods, along with their probabilistic reasoning have been added to database systems. Allowing approximate and probabilistic answers is essential for many applications. Many believe that XML and xQuery will be the main data structure and access pattern. Database systems must accommodate that perspective. External data increasingly arrives as streams to be compared to historical data; so stream-processing operators are being added to the DBMS. Publish-subscribe systems invert the data-query ratios; incoming data is compared against millions of queries rather than queries searching millions of records. Meanwhile, disk and memory capacities are growing much faster than their bandwidth and latency, so the database systems increasingly use huge main memories and sequential disk access. These changes mandate a much more dynamic query optimization strategy - one that adapts to current conditions and selectivities rather than having a static plan. Intelligence is moving to the periphery of the network. Each disk and each sensor will be a competent database machine. Relational algebra is a convenient way to program these systems. Database systems are now expected to be self-managing, self-healing, and always-up. We researchers and developers have our work cut out for us in delivering all these features."	#*The Next Database Revolution. #@Jim Gray #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99aecb7602d9702373cec #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56

To diminish the impact of inaccurate estimates during optimization, statistics on query expressions (SITs) have been previously proposed. These statistics help directly model the distribution of tuples on query sub-plans. Past work in statistics on query expressions has exploited view matching technology to harness their benefits. In this paper we argue against such an approach as it overlooks significant opportunities for improvement in cardinality estimations. We then introduce a framework to reason with SITs based on the notion of conditional selectivity. We present a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently find the most accurate selectivity estimation for given queries, and discuss how such an approach can be incorporated into existing optimizers with a small number of changes. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that our technique results in superior cardinality estimations than previous approaches with very little overhead."	#*Conditional Selectivity for Statistics on Query Expressions. #@Nicolas Bruno, Surajit Chaudhuri #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e99ebdb7602d9702783702 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e9b048b7602d9703aa8491 #%53e9b30ab7602d9703dd20e6 #%53e9aeddb7602d970390804a #%53e9ae17b7602d970382881d #%53e9ab38b7602d97034c696d #%53e9afbab7602d9703a0a1aa #%53e9ba69b7602d9704687880 #%53e9ae48b7602d970385cf97 #%53e9b8e8b7602d97044c93db #%53e99821b7602d970203ea94
"#*Building dynamic application networks with Web Services #@Matthew Mihic #t2004 #cSIGMOD '04 Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data #index5390972920f70186a0dfacd5 #!Looking at the state of the industry today, it is clear that we are in the early stages of Web Services development. Companies are still evaluating what the technology and considering how to apply it to their business. But over the past year, we seem to have reached an inflection point of companies building real systems based on Web Services. Partly this reflects an acceptance that the basic Web Services technologies - XML Schema [1][2], SOAP [3], WSDL [4] - have matured to the point where they can be used for mission critical applications. But it also reflects a growing understanding that Web Services enable a large class of systems that were previously very difficult to build. These systems are characterized by several critical properties:1. Rapid rates of change. The time is long past when companies could afford a year-long-effort to build out a new application. Businesses move at a faster pace today then ever before, and they are increasingly under pressure to do more work with fewer resources. This places a premium on the ability to build applications by quickly composing pre-existing services. The result is that systems are being connected in ways that were never imagined during development. This is reuse in the large - not just small services, but entire applications being linked together to solve a complex business function.2. Significant availability and scalability requirements. Many of these systems are \"bet-your-business\" types of applications. They have heavy scalability and availability requirements. Often then need to connect multiple partners and service hundreds of thousands of updates in a day, without ever suffering an interruption in service.3. Heterogeneous development tools and software platforms. Each of these applications typically involves components built using a wildly diverse set of tools, operating systems, and software platforms. Partly this is a result of building systems out of existing components - many of these components are locked into certain environments, and there are no resources to rewrite or migrate to a single homogenous platform. But it is also recognition that different problems are best solved by different toolsets. Some problems are best solved by writing code on an application server, others are best suited for scripting, and still others are solved by customizing an existing enterprise application. Heterogeneity is not going away. It is only increasing.4. Multiple domains of administrative control. An aspect of heterogeneity that is often overlooked is distributed ownership. As businesses merge, acquire, and partner with other companies, there is an increasing need to build applications that span organizational boundaries.These characteristics present a unique set of challenges to the way we think about developing, describing, connecting, and configuring applications. The challenges require us to develop new ways of looking at what it takes to build an application, and what makes up a network.In this session, we examine the nature of this next generation of application, and discuss the way in which Web Services are evolving to meet their needs. The session focuses on the development techniques that allow services to be easily and dynamically composed into rich applications, and considers the capabilities required of the underlying network fabric. The session concludes with an in-depth look at some of the critical Web Services specifications actively under development by industry leaders."	#*Building Dynamic Application Networks with Web Services. #@Matthew Mihic #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9b365b7602d9703e41ee0 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56

Migration is important for stream monitoring systems where long-running queries may have to withstand fluctuations in stream workloads and data characteristics. Existing migration methods generally adopt a pause-drain-resume strategy that pauses the processing of new data, purges all old data in the existing plan, until finally the new plan can be plugged into the system. However, these existing strategies do not address the problem of migrating query plans that contain stateful operators, such as joins. We now develop solutions for online plan migration for continuous stateful plans. In particular, in this paper, we propose two alternative strategies, called the moving state strategy and the parallel track strategy, one exploiting reusability and the second employs parallelism to seamlessly migrate between continuous join plans without affecting the results of the query. We develop cost models for both migration strategies to analytically compare them. We embed these migration strategies into the CAPE [7], a prototype system of a stream query engine, and conduct a comparative experimental study to evaluate these two strategies for window-based join plans. Our experimental results illustrate that the two strategies can vary significantly in terms of output rates and intermediate storage spaces given distinct system configurations and stream workloads."	#*Dynamic Plan Migration for Continuous Queries Over Data Streams. #@Yali Zhu, Elke A.

This severely limits their applicability, since in practice movement is more complex, and individual objects may follow drastically diffferent motion patterns. In order to overcome these problems, we first introduce a general framework for monitoring and indexing moving objects, where (i) each boject computes individually the function that accurately captures its movement and (ii) a server indexes the object locations at a coarse level and processes queries using a filter-refinement mechanism. Our second contribution is a novel recursive motion function that supports a broad class of non-linear motion patterns. The function does not presume any a-priori movement but can postulate the particular motion of each object by examining its locations at recent timestamps.

To support efficient evaluation of path expressions, many structural indexes have been proposed. The most popular ones are the 1-index, based on the notion of graph bisimilarity, and the recently proposed A(k)-index, based on the notion of local similarity to provide a trade-off between index size and query answering power. For these indexes to be practical, we need effective and efficient incremental maintenance algorithms to keep them consistent with the underlying data. However, existing update algorithms for structural indexes essentially provide no guarantees on the quality of the index; the updated index is usually larger size than necessary, degrading the performance for subsequent queries.In this paper, we propose update algorithms for the 1-index and the A(k)-index with provable guarantees on the resulting index quality. Our algorithms always maintain a minimal index, i.e., merging any two index nodes would result in an incorrect index. For the 1-index, if the data graph is acyclic, our algorithm further ensures that the index is minimum, i.e., it has the least number of index nodes possible. For the A(k)-index, we show that the minimal index our algorithm maintains is also the unique minimum A(k)-index, for both acyclic and cyclic data graphs. Finally, through experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our algorithms bring significant improvement over previous methods, in terms of both index size and update time."	#*Incremental Maintenance of XML Structural Indexes. #@Ke Yi, Hao He, Ioana Stanoi, Jun Yang 0001 #t2004 #cSIGMOD Conference #index53e9babab7602d97046eaffe #%53e9ac54b7602d9703624c56 #%53e99ae7b7602d97023705fd #%53e99fc9b7602d97028a38ae #%53e99afdb7602d970238ac7a #%53e9b326b7602d9703df6eca #%53e9b80fb7602d97043c02a4 #%53e9a2dcb7602d9702be39ff #%53e9aa61b7602d97033d327a #%53e9b1c3b7602d9703c53a60 #%53e998bfb7602d97020f8520

The benefits of such adaptivity can be significant, especially in highly dynamic environments such as data streams, sensor query processing, web querying, etc. Various parties have asserted that the cost of making per-tuple routing decisions is prohibitive. We have implemented eddies in the PostgreSQL open source database system [1] in the context of the TelegraphCQ project.

In several environments, this may be impractical. In this paper, we study key agreement protocols for which two sensor nodes (who do not necessarily have a shared key from the key predistribution phase) could establish a secure communication channel against active adversaries (e.g., denial of service attacks) without the involvement of the base station."	#*Robust key establishment in sensor networks. #@Yongge Wang #t2004 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9a833b7602d970317d4fd #%53e99b30b7602d97023cba3b #%53e9be1ab7602d9704ad2032 #%53e9b572b7602d97040afdf3 #%53e9ad1fb7602d9703702546 #%53e9b8efb7602d97044d5156

Due to this reason, most algorithms for data streams sacrifice the correctness of their results for fast processing time. The processing time is greatly influenced by the amount of information that should be maintained. This paper proposes a statistical grid-based approach to clustering data elements of a data stream. Initially, the multidimensional data space of a data stream is partitioned into a set of mutually exclusive equal-size initial cells. When the support of a cell becomes high enough, the cell is dynamically divided into two mutually exclusive intermediate cells based on its distribution statistics. Three different ways of partitioning a dense cell are introduced. Eventually, a dense region of each initial cell is recursively partitioned until it becomes the smallest cell called a unit cell. A cluster of a data stream is a group of adjacent dense unit cells. In order to minimize the number of cells, a sparse intermediate or unit cell is pruned if its support becomes much less than a minimum support. Furthermore, in order to confine the usage of memory space, the size of a unit cell is dynamically minimized such that the result of clustering becomes as accurate as possible. The proposed algorithm is analyzed by a series of experiments to identify its various characteristics."	#*Statistical grid-based clustering over data streams. #@Nam Hun Park, Won Suk Lee #t2004 #cSIGMOD Record #index53e9bc2cb7602d9704897121 #%53e9a839b7602d970318501b #%53e9aab0b7602d97034285b3 #%53e9b360b7602d9703e3f35e #%53e99b9bb7602d9702445abb

As sensors become smaller, cheaper and more configurable, systems incorporating large numbers of them become feasible. Besides the technological aspects of sensor design, a critical factor enabling future sensor-driven applications will be the availability of an integrated infrastructure taking care of the onus of data management. Ideally, accessing sensor data should be no difficult or inconvenient than using simple SQL.In this paper we investigate some of the issues that such an infrastructure must address. Unlike conventional distributed database systems, a sensor data architecture must handle extremely high data generation rates from a large number of small autonomous components. And, unlike the emerging paradigm of data streams, it is infeasible to think that all this data can be streamed into the query processing site, due to severe bandwidth and energy constraints of battery-operated wireless sensors. Thus, sensing data architectures must become quality-aware, regulating the quality of data at all levels of the distributed system, and supporting user applications' quality requirements in the most efficient manner possible."	#*QUASAR: quality aware sensing architecture. #@Iosif Lazaridis, Qi Han, Xingbo Yu, Sharad Mehrotra, Nalini Venkatasubramanian, Dmitri V.

Three different approximation techniques are proposed, which show how to forsake query precision for improved performance. Measures are defined that can quantify the improvements in performance efficiency and the quality of approximations. The proposed approximation techniques are then tested on various synthetic and real-life files. The evidence obtained from the experiments confirms our hypothesis that a high-quality approximated similarity search can be performed at a much lower cost than that needed to obtain the exact results.

This paper explores how to integrate the reliable memory provided by the Rio file cache into a database system. Prior studies have analyzed the performance benefits of reliable memory; we focus instead on how different designs affect reliability. We propose three designs for integrating reliable memory into databases: non-persistent database buffer cache, persistent database buffer cache, and persistent database buffer cache with protection. Non-persistent buffer caches use an I/O interface to reliable memory and require the fewest modifications to existing databases. However, they waste memory capacity and bandwidth due to double buffering. Persistent buffer caches use a memory interface to reliable memory by mapping it into the database address space. This places reliable memory under complete database control and eliminates double buffering, but it may expose the buffer cache to database errors. Our third design reduces this exposure by write protecting the buffer pages. Extensive fault tests show that mapping reliable memory into the database address space does not significantly hurt reliability. This is because wild stores rarely touch dirty, committed pages written by previous transactions. As a result, we believe that databases should use a memory interface to reliable memory."	#*Integrating Reliable Memory in Databases. #@Wee Teck Ng, Peter M.

A path-method is a method which traverses from one class through a chain of connections between classes and accesses information at another class. However, it is a difficult task for a casual user or even an application programmer to write path-methods to facilitate queries. This is because it might require comprehensive knowledge of many classes of the conceptual schema that are not directly involved in the query, and therefore may not even be included in a user's (incomplete) view about the contents of the database. We have developed a system, called path-method generator (PMG), which generates path-methods automatically according to a user's database-manipulating requests. The PMG offers the user one of the possible path-methods and the user verifies from his knowledge of the intended purpose of the request whether that path-method is the desired one. If the path method is rejected, then the user can utilize his now increased knowledge about the database to request (with additional parameters given) another offer from the PMG. The PMG is based on access weights attached to the connections between classes and precomputed access relevance between every pair of classes of the OODB. Specific rules for access weight assignment and algorithms for computing access relevance appeared in our previous papers [MGPF92, MGPF93, MGPF96]. In this paper, we present a variety of traversal algorithms based on access weights and precomputed access relevance.

The knowledge can be helpful for proper allocation of buffer space to various database relations, as well as for the management of buffer space for a mixed transaction and query environment. Access characterization can also be used to predict the buffer invalidation effect in a multi-node environment which, in turn, can influence transaction routing strategies. However, it is a challenge to characterize the database access pattern of a real workload reference trace in a simple manner that can easily be used to compute buffer hit probability. In this article, we use a characterization method that distinguishes three types of access patterns from a trace: (1) locality within a transaction, (2) random accesses by transactions, and (3) sequential accesses by long queries. We then propose a concise way to characterize the access skew across randomly accessed pages by logically grouping the large number of data pages into a small number of partitions such that the frequency of accessing each page within a partition can be treated as equal. Based on this approach, we present a recursive binary partitioning algorithm that can infer the access skew characterization from the buffer hit probabilities for a subset of the buffer sizes. We validate the buffer hit predictions for single and multiple node systems using production database traces. We further show that the proposed approach can predict the buffer hit probability of a composite workload from those of its component files."	#*Characterization of Database Access Pattern for Analytic Prediction of Buffer Hit Probability #@Asit Dan, Philip S.

Such a view mechanism makes it possible for users to transparently work with data in a relational database as if it was stored in an object-oriented (OO) database. A query against the object view is translated to one or several queries against the relational database. The results of these queries are then processed to form an answer to the initial query. The approach is not restricted to a ‘pure’ object view mechanism for the relational data, since the object view can also store its own data and methods. Therefore it must be possible to process queries that combine local data residing in the object view with data retrieved from the relational database. We discuss the key issues when object views of relational databases are developed, namely: how to map relational structures to sub-type/supertype hierarchies in the view, how to represent relational database access in OO query plans, how to provide the concept of object identity in the view, how to handle the fact that the extension of types in the view depends on the state of the relational database, and how to process and optimize queries against the object view. The results are based on experiences from a running prototype implementation."	#*Query Processing Over Object Views of Relational Data. #@Gustav Fahl, Tore Risch #t1997 #cVLDB J. #index53e9ba0bb7602d970460e0fa #%53e99a8bb7602d97022feca6 #%53e99aacb7602d9702329291 #%53e9aeeab7602d97039149da #%53e9b7eeb7602d97043a0e20 #%53e9a987b7602d97032e43db #%53e99b9bb7602d9702444ee8 #%53e9af2db7602d9703968545 #%53e9a003b7602d97028e92d1 #%53e9aa48b7602d97033b798b #%53e9a704b7602d970303aa1e #%53e9a6cab7602d9702ffe612 #%53e9acf6b7602d97036d42b2 #%53e9b512b7602d9704046062 #%53e9b344b7602d9703e1885d #%53e9ba39b7602d970464b327 #%53e9aef1b7602d970391ff75 #%53e9a401b7602d9702d1ceb3 #%53e99beab7602d97024925ba #%53e9b8a8b7602d9704484f8f #%53e9adf0b7602d97037fcab6 #%53e9b44bb7602d9703f44f90 #%53e9bd92b7602d9704a39b61 #%53e9bd6fb7602d9704a0f8ec #%53e9abf7b7602d97035ba6e2 #%53e9a7c8b7602d9703109317

This paper develops an integrated approach to the vertical data migration between the tertiary, secondary, and primary storage in that it reconciles speculative prefetching, to mask the high latency of the tertiary storage, with the replacement policy of the document caches at the secondary and primary storage level, and also considers the interaction of these policies with the tertiary and secondary storage request scheduling. The integrated migration policy is based on a continuous-time Markov chain model for predicting the expected number of accesses to a document within a specified time horizon. Prefetching is initiated only if that expectation is higher than those of the documents that need to be dropped from secondary storage to free up the necessary space. In addition, the possible resource contention at the tertiary and secondary storage is taken into account by dynamically assessing the response-time benefit of prefetching a document versus the penalty that it would incur on the response time of the pending document requests. The parameters of the continuous-time Markov chain model, the probabilities of co-accessing certain documents and the interaction times between successive accesses, are dynamically estimated and adjusted to evolving workload patterns by keeping online statistics. The integrated policy for vertical data migration has been implemented in a prototype system. The system makes profitable use of the Markov chain model also for the scheduling of volume exchanges in the tertiary storage library. Detailed simulation experiments with Web-server-like synthetic workloads indicate significant gains in terms of client response time. The experiments also show that the overhead of the statistical bookkeeping and the computations for the access predictions is affordable."	#*Integrated Document Caching and Prefetching in Storage Hierarchies Based on Markov-Chain Predictions. #@Achim Kraiss, Gerhard Weikum #t1998 #cVLDB J. #index53e9aed1b7602d97038fced8 #%53e99ed1b7602d970279a98c #%53e99e8cb7602d97027563c1 #%53e9aed1b7602d97038fe0f5 #%53e99cfdb7602d97025b4b4f #%53e9a790b7602d97030cb120 #%53e9b082b7602d9703aebfa7 #%53e9a178b7602d9702a6b652 #%53e9b740b7602d97042da0da #%53e99a92b7602d97023097d4 #%53e9aafab7602d970347b7dc #%53e9a88db7602d97031db79d #%53e9a0bbb7602d97029a4895 #%53e9bb52b7602d970478ff47 #%53e9b999b7602d970458b4e4 #%53e9a31eb7602d9702c2592a #%53e99c7db7602d9702531178 #%53e9ad6cb7602d9703759231 #%53e9b50bb7602d970403f2b3 #%53e99cb5b7602d97025672a1 #%53e99b2cb7602d97023c639d #%53e9ab26b7602d97034b3403 #%53e99d74b7602d970262d858 #%53e9a66db7602d9702f9dee9 #%53e9b4b4b7602d9703fcca63 #%53e9a8dbb7602d970322a19e #%53e9ad34b7602d9703719e4f #%53e9b77cb7602d970431fcb9 #%53e99d8eb7602d970264b272 #%53e9a4b1b7602d9702dce89c #%53e9b4c3b7602d9703fdc042 #%53e99d96b7602d970264fda3 #%53e9991cb7602d9702157240 #%53e9ab20b7602d97034a9059

Most of this work assumes a monolithic architecture of the multidatabase system with a single software module that follows a single transaction management algorithm to ensure the consistency of data stored in the local databases. This monolithic architecture is not appropriate in a multidatabase environment where the system spans multiple different organizations that are distributed over various geographically distant locations. In this paper, we propose an alternative multidatabase transaction management architecture, where the system is hierarchical in nature. Hierarchical architecture has consequences on the design of transaction management algorithms. An implication of the architecture is that the transaction management algorithms followed by a multidatabase system must be composable– that is, it must be possible to incorporate individual multidatabase systems as elements in a larger multidatabase system. We present a hierarchical architecture for a multidatabase environment and develop techniques for concurrency control in such systems."	#*Concurrency Control in Hierarchical Multidatabase Systems. #@Sharad Mehrotra, Henry F.

TIGUKAT has a novel object model, whose identifying characteristics include a purely behavioral semantics and a uniform approach to objects. Everything in the system, including types, classes, collections, behaviors, and functions, as well as meta-information, is a first-class object with well-defined behavior. In this way, the model abstracts everything, including traditional structural notions such as instance variables, method implementation, and schema definition, into a uniform semantics of behaviors on objects. Our emphasis in this article is on the object model, its implementation, the persistence model, and the query language. We also (briefly) present other database management functions that are under development such as the query optimizer, the version control system, and the transaction manager."	#*TIGUKAT: A Uniform Behavioral Objectbase Management System #@M.

For maintaining and querying these multiversion data efficiently, external storage structures are an absolute necessity. We propose a multiversion B-tree that supports insertions and deletions of data items at the current version and range queries and exact match queries for any version, current or past. Our multiversion B-tree is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the time and space bounds are asymptotically the same as those of the (single-version) B-tree in the worst case. The technique we present for transforming a (single-version) B-tree into a multiversion B-tree is quite general: it applies to a number of hierarchical external access structures with certain properties directly, and it can be modified for others."	#*An Asymptotically Optimal Multiversion B-Tree. #@Bruno Becker, Stephan Gschwind, Thomas Ohler, Bernhard Seeger, Peter Widmayer #t1996 #cVLDB J. #index53e9a297b7602d9702b9cf03 #%53e9ac6ab7602d970363e4da #%53e9a833b7602d970317d054 #%53e9978ab7602d9701f47d3f #%53e99a62b7602d97022cd655 #%53e9b26eb7602d9703d0f914 #%53e9b010b7602d9703a67bd6 #%53e9bc73b7602d97048f26d3 #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e9b1c9b7602d9703c5a7b1 #%53e9b240b7602d9703cdc370 #%53e9a38fb7602d9702c9e1a0 #%53e9a94cb7602d97032a165a #%53e999adb7602d97021eeece #%53e9aee4b7602d9703913295

This paper introduces the role mechanism as an extension of object-oriented databases to support unanticipated behavioral oscillations for objects that may attain many types and share a single object identity. A role refers to the ability to represent object dynamics by seamlessly integrating idiosyncratic behavior, possibly in response to external events, with pre-existing object behavior specified at instance creation time. In this manner, the same object can simultaneously be an instance of different classes which symbolize the different roles that this object assumes. The role concept and its underlying linguistic scheme simplify the design requirements of complex applications that need to create and manipulate dynamic objects."	#*Erratum: A Database Model for Object Dynamics. #@Mike P.

Consequently, the access scope of a query against a class in general includes the access scope of all its subclasses, unless specified otherwise. An index to support superclass-subclass relationship efficiently must provide efficient associative retrievals of objects from a single class or from several classes in a class hierarchy. This paper presents an efficient index called the hierarchical tree (the H-tree). For each class, an H-tree is maintained, allowing efficient search on a single class. These H-trees are appropriately linked to capture the superclass-subclass relationships, thus allowing efficient retrievals of instances from a class hierarchy. Both experimental and analytical results indicate that the H-tree is an efficient indexing structure."	#*Index Nesting - An Efficient Approach to Indexing in Object-Oriented Databases #@Beng Chin Ooi, Jiawei Han, Hongjun Lu, Kian-Lee Tan #t1996 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b5ceb7602d9704119167 #%53e9b911b7602d97044f76d9 #%53e9bcb3b7602d97049354af #%53e9a464b7602d9702d8183b #%53e9bd7bb7602d9704a20bb7 #%53e9a952b7602d97032aa6e3 #%53e9a75fb7602d9703099d48

Using commodity processors, memory, and arrays of SCSI disks, AlphaSort runs the industry-standard sort benchmark in seven seconds. This beats the best published record on a 32-CPU 32-disk Hypercube by 8:1. On another benchmark, AlphaSort sorted more than a gigabyte in one minute. AlphaSort is a cache-sensitive, memory-intensive sort algorithm. We argue that modern architectures require algorithm designers to re-examine their use of the memory hierarchy. AlphaSort uses clustered data structures to get good cache locality, file striping to get high disk bandwidth, QuickSort to generate runs, and replacement-selection to merge the runs. It uses shared memory multiprocessors to break the sort into subsort chores. Because startup times are becoming a significant part of the total time, we propose two new benchmarks: (1) MinuteSort: how much can you sort in one minute, and (2) PennySort: how much can you sort for one penny."	#*AlphaSort: A Cache-Sensitive Parallel External Sort #@Chris Nyberg, Tom Barclay, Zarka Cvetanovic, Jim Gray, David B.

Normal requests from clients to the server and replies from the server to clients can be transmitted using direct or recoverable messages. In addition, an application event notification mechanism is provided, whereby client applications running anywhere on the network can register for events, and when those events are raised, the clients are notified. A novel parameter passing mechanism allows a set of tuples to be included in an event notification. The event mechanism is particularly useful in an active DBMS, where events can be raised by triggers to signal running application programs."	#*A Flexible and Recoverable Client/Server Database Event Notification System. #@Eric N.

We first describe the salient features of the language: types, names, classes, integrity constraints (including methods), and transactions. The inclusion of methods into integrity constraints allows an increase of the declarative power of these constraints. Indeed, the information needed to define a constraint is not always stored in the database through attributes, but is sometimes computed or derived data. Then, we address the problem of efficiently checking constraints. More specifically, we consider two different problems: (1) statically reducing the number of constraints to be checked, and (2) generating an efficient run-time checker. Using simple strategies, one can significantly improve the efficiency of the verification. We show how to reduce the number of constraints to be checked by characterizing the portions of the database that are involved in both the constraints and in a transaction. We also show how to generate efficient algorithms for checking a large class of constraints. We show how all the techniques presented exploit the underlying type system, which provides significant help in solving (1) and (2). Last, the current status of the Thémis prototype is presented."	#*Thémis: A Database Programming Language Handling Integrity Constraints #@Véronique Benzaken, Anne Doucet #t1995 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b7adb7602d970435685a #%53e9ab6fb7602d970350df82 #%53e99ef4b7602d97027bef53 #%53e997e4b7602d9701fddf34 #%53e9b7c7b7602d97043747e2 #%53e9bbadb7602d97047f9560 #%53e99946b7602d9702184bdd #%53e9b0fbb7602d9703b782fe #%53e9b6dcb7602d970426db06 #%53e9ac8fb7602d9703669372 #%53e9b388b7602d9703e67797 #%53e9a906b7602d9703259fcc #%53e9b7adb7602d9704353ec5

The search for more flexible correctness criteria is partily motivated by the introduction of new transaction models that extend the traditional atomic transaction model. These extensions came about because the atomic transaction model in conjunction with serializability is found to be very constraining when used in advanced applications (e.g., design databases) that function in distributed, cooperative, and heterogeneous environments.In this article we develop a taxonomy of various correctness criteria that focus on database consistency requirements and transaction correctness properties from the viewpoint of what the different dimensions of these two are. This taxonomy allows us to categorize correctness criteria that have been proposed in the literature. To help in this categorization, we have applied a uniform specification technique, based on ACTA, to express the various criteria. Such a categorization helps shed light on the similarities and differences between different criteria and places them in perspective."	#*A Taxonomy of Correctness Criteria in Database Applications #@Krithi Ramamritham, Panos K.

Data are loaded into each client cache based on queries executed on the central database at the server. These queries are used to form predicates that describe the cache contents. A subsequent query at the client may be satisfied in its local cache if we can determine that the query result is entirely contained in the cache. This issue is called cache completeness. A separate issue, cache currency, deals with the effect on client caches of updates committed at the central database. We examine the various performance tradeoffs and optimization issues involved in addressing the questions of cache currency and completeness using predicate descriptions and suggest solutions that promote good dynamic behavior. Lower query-response times, reduced message traffic, higher server throughput, and better scalability are some of the expected benefits of our approach over commonly used relational server-side and object ID-based or page-based client-side caching."	#*A Predicate-based Caching Scheme for Client-Server Database Architectures #@Arthur M.

Our approach has two main motivations: First, locking protocols are widely accepted and used in most database systems. Second, in real-time databases it has been shown that the blocking behavior of transactions in locking protocols results in performance degradation. We use a new relationship between locks called ordered sharing to eliminate blocking that arises in the traditional locking protocols. Ordered sharing eliminates blocking of read and write operations but may result in delayed termination. Since timeliness and not response time is the crucial factor in real-time databases, our protocols exploit this delay to allow transactions to execute within the slacks of delayed transactions. We compare the performance of the proposed protocols with the two-phase locking protocol for real-time databases. Our experiments indicate that the proposed protocols significantly reduce the percentage of missed deadlines in the system for a variety of workloads."	#*Ordered Shared Locks for Real-Time Databases #@Divyakant Agrawal, Amr El Abbadi, Richard Jeffers, Lijing Lin #t1995 #cVLDB J. #index53e9a216b7602d9702b1b54d #%53e99f20b7602d97027ec65d #%53e9ac6ab7602d970363e4da #%53e9aa0fb7602d9703379635 #%53e9b903b7602d97044e6607 #%53e9a66eb7602d9702fa2f66 #%53e9ab73b7602d9703517c2c #%53e9af46b7602d9703985c3e #%53e9b9f4b7602d97045ed14c #%53e9ae49b7602d970385f8f1 #%53e9aa16b7602d9703386cf8 #%53e9ad12b7602d97036f31cb #%53e9a699b7602d9702fcc9a8 #%53e9a464b7602d9702d805f7 #%53e9a8b0b7602d97031ff36e #%53e9b8f6b7602d97044dd408 #%53e9b74bb7602d97042e9ed8 #%53e9a90db7602d970325cc3e #%53e9a3edb7602d9702d04ac6 #%53e9acc4b7602d97036a3bdf #%53e9abc9b7602d970357c090 #%53e9a5fdb7602d9702f2d1ca #%53e99e93b7602d9702757080 #%53e9b33eb7602d9703e14360

IBM has provided strong validation of the concept with their \"Information Warehouse.\" DBMS vendors are providing gateways into their products, and SQL is being retrofitted on many older DBMSs to make it easier to access data from standard 4GL products and application development systems. The next step needed for data integration is to provide (1) a common data dictionary with a conceptual schema across the data to mask the many differences that occur when databases are developed independently and (2) a server that can access and integrate the databases using information from the data dictionary. In this article, we discuss InterViso, one of the first commercial federated database products. InterViso is based on Mermaid, which was developed at SDC and Unisys (Templeton et al., 1987b). It provides a value added layer above connectivity products to handle views across databases, schema translation, and transaction management."	#*InterViso: Dealing With the Complexity of Federated Database Access #@Marjorie Templeton, Herbert Henley, Edward Maros, Darrel J.

We used ParSets to parallelize the graph traversal portion of the OO7 OODBMS benchmark, and present speedup and scaleup results from parallel SHORE running these traversals on a cluster of commodity workstations connected by a standard ethernet. For some OO7 traversals, SHORE achieved excellent speedup and scaleup; for other OO7 traversals, only marginal speedup and scaleup occurred. The characteristics of these traversals shed light on when the ParSet approach to parallelism can and cannot be applied to speed up an application."	#*Parallelising OODBMS Traversals: A Performance Evaluation #@David J.

Algebraic, calculus-based, and logic-programming oriented languages have all been considered. This article presents a general model for complex values (i.e., values with hierarchical structures), and languages for it based on the three paradigms. The algebraic language generalizes those presented in the literature; it is shown to be related to the functional style of programming advocated by Backus (1978). The notion of domain independence (from relational databases) is defined, and syntactic restrictions (referred to as safety conditions) on calculus queries are formulated to guarantee domain independence. The main results are: The domain-independent calculus, the safe calculus, the algebra, and the logic-programming oriented language have equivalent expressive power. In particular, recursive queries, such as the transitive closure, can be expressed in each of the languages. For this result, the algebra needs the powerset operation. A more restricted version of safety is presented, such that the restricted safe calculus is equivalent to the algebra without the powerset. The results are extended to the case where arbitrary functions and predicates are used in the languages."	#*The Power of Languages for the Manipulation of Complex Values #@Serge Abiteboul, Catriel Beeri #t1995 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b8a8b7602d9704480ef1 #%53e9b3b1b7602d9703e9394d #%53e99a8bb7602d97022feca6 #%53e99e69b7602d970272c2b7 #%53e9a113b7602d9702a00788 #%53e9b0c7b7602d9703b3c9d0 #%53e9af3fb7602d970397bfe6 #%53e99fd6b7602d97028aff76 #%53e99d58b7602d9702614019 #%53e9afdab7602d9703a2ccce #%53e9b80fb7602d97043c06d7 #%53e9b8dab7602d97044bc04f #%53e997a2b7602d9701f76775 #%53e99d9db7602d9702657cc7 #%53e9aa86b7602d97033fea26 #%53e99e93b7602d9702759e01 #%53e9a48eb7602d9702daf13b #%53e9bb36b7602d9704771afe #%53e997a2b7602d9701f73e89 #%53e9a501b7602d9702e20e67 #%53e9b4b0b7602d9703fc3a36 #%53e9b0d1b7602d9703b497db #%53e9a1c3b7602d9702abc5e4 #%53e99c29b7602d97024d5e2c #%53e9bd18b7602d97049a474d #%53e99838b7602d970205fdb5 #%53e9aa09b7602d9703373f73 #%53e9b124b7602d9703ba2cb9 #%53e9b1c2b7602d9703c50d8d #%53e9999eb7602d97021e72c7 #%53e9bdceb7602d9704a807ca #%53e9a593b7602d9702ebb764 #%53e9a2ebb7602d9702bf3876

To minimize risk, these solutions must build on existing investments, permit the best technology to be applied to the problem, and be manageable. Object technology, with its promise of improved productivity and quality in application development, delivers these characteristics but, to date, its deployment in commercial business applications has been limited. One possible reason is the absence of the transaction paradigm, widely used in commercial environments and essential for reliable business applications. For object technology to be a serious contender in the construction of these solutions requires: – technology for transactional objects. In December 1994, the Object Management Group adopted a specification for an object transaction service (OTS). The OTS specifies mechanisms for defining and manipulating transactions. Though derived from the X/Open distributed transaction processing model, OTS contains additional enhancements specifically designed for the object environment. Similar technology from Microsoft appeared at the end of 1995. – methodologies for building new business systems from existing parts. Business process re-engineering is forcing businesses to improve their operations which bring products to market. Workflow computing, when used in conjunction with “object wrappers” provides tools to both define and track execution of business processes which leverage existing applications and infrastructure. – an execution environment which satisfies the requirements of the operational needs of the business. Transaction processing (TP) monitor technology, though widely accepted for mainframe transaction processing, has yet to enjoy similar success in the client/server marketplace. Instead the database vendors, with their extensive tool suites, dominate. As object brokers mature they will require many of the functions of today's TP monitors. Marrying these two technologies can produce a robust execution environment which offers a superior alternative for building and deploying client/server applications."	#*The Impact of Technology on Commercial Transaction Processing. #@Edward E.

All of these, however, deviate significantly from the original relational model. This paper presents a temporal extension of the relational algebra that is not significantly different from the original relational model, yet is at least as expressive as any of the previous approaches. This algebra employs multidimensional tuple time-stamping to capture the complete temporal behavior of data. The basic relational operations are redefined as consistent extensions of the existing operations in a manner that preserves the basic algebraic equivalences of the snapshot (i.e., conventional static) algebra. A new operation, namely temporal projection, is introduced. The complete update semantics are formally specified and aggregate functions are defined. The algebra is closed, and reduces to the snapshot algebra. It is also shown to be at least as expressive as the calculus-based temporal query language TQuel.

Similar to semi-joins in distributed query processing, hash filters can be applied to eliminate non-matching tuples from joining relations before the execution of a join, thus reducing the join cost. Note that hash filters built in different execution stages of a bushy tree can have different costs and effects. The effect of hash filters is evaluat ed first. Then, an efficient scheme to determine an effective sequence of hash filters for a bushy execution tree is developed, where hash filters are built and applied based on the join sequence specified in the bushy tree so that not only is the reduction effect optimized but also the cost associated is minimized. Various schemes using hash filters are implemented and evaluated via simulation. It is experimentally shown that the application of hash filters is in general a very powerful means to improve th e execution of multi-join queries, and the improvement becomes more prominent as the number of relations in a query increases."	#*On Applying Hash Filters to Improving the Execution of Multi-Join Queries. #@Ming-Syan Chen, Hui-I Hsiao, Philip S.

Palmtop-based units will often be disconnected for prolonged periods of time, due to battery power saving measures; palmtops also will frequently relocate between different cells, and will connect to different data servers at different times. Caching of frequently accessed data items will be an important technique that will reduce contention on the narrowbandwidth, wireless channel. However, cache individualization strategies will be severely affected by the disconnection and mobility of the clients. The server may no longer know which clients are currently residing under its cell, and which of them are currently on. We propose a taxonomy of different cache invalidation strategies, and study the impact of clients' disconnection times on their performance. We study ways to improve further the efficiency of the invalidation techniques described. We also describe how our techniques can be implemented over different network environments."	#*Sleepers and Workaholics: Caching Strategies in Mobile Environments #@Daniel Barbará, Tomasz Imielinski #t1995 #cVLDB J. #index53e9ba0bb7602d970460aba7

This article presents the results of a detailed performance study using the OO7 benchmark. The study compares the performance of QuickStore with the latest implementation of the E programming language. The QuickStore and E systems exemplify the two basic approaches (hardware and software) that have been used to implement persistence in object-oriented database systems. In addition, both systems use the same underlying storage manager and compiler, allowing us to make a truly apples-to-apples comparison of the hardware and software techniques."	#*QuickStore: A High Performance Mapped Object Store #@Seth J.

Such knowledge bases cannot be built using existing tools such as expert system shells, because these do not scale up, nor can they be built in terms of existing database technology, because such technology does not support the rich representational structure and inference mechanisms required for knowledge-based systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture for a knowledge base management system intended for such applications. The architecture assumes an object-oriented knowledge representation language with an assertional sublanguage used to express constraints and rules. It also provides for general-purpose deductive inference and special-purpose temporal reasoning. Results reported in the paper address several knowledge base management issues. For storage management, a new method is proposed for generating a logical schema for a given knowledge base. Query processing algorithms are offered for semantic and physical query optimization, along with an enhanced cost model for query cost estimation. On concurrency control, the paper describes a novel concurrency control policy which takes advantage of knowledge base structure and is shown to outperform two-phase locking for highly structured knowledge bases and update-intensive transactions. Finally, algorithms for compilation and efficient processing of constraints and rules during knowledge base operations are described. The paper describes original results, including novel data structures and algorithms, as well as preliminary performance evaluation data. Based on these results, we conclude that knowledge base management systems which can accommodate large knowledge bases are feasible."	#*Building Knowledge Base Management Systems. #@John Mylopoulos, Vinay K.

It allows users to frame queries in terms of the logical structure of the data, letting a query processor automatically translate them into optimal plans that access physical storage structures. Both relational and object-oriented systems, however, force users to frame their queries in terms of a logical schema that is directly tied to physical structures. We present an approach that eliminates this dependence. All storage structures are defined in a declarative language based on relational algebra as functions of a logical schema. We present an algorithm, integrated with a conventional query optimizer, that translates queries over this logical schema into plans that access the storage structures. We also show how to compile update requests into plans that update all relevant storage structures consistently and optimally. Finally, we report on experiments with a prototype implementation of our approach that demonstrate how it allows storage structures to be tuned to the expected or observed workload to achieve significantly better performance than is possible with conventional techniques."	#*The GMAP: A Versatile Tool for Physical Data Independence #@Odysseas G.

Parametric query optimization attempts to identify at compile time several execution plans, each one of which is optimal for a subset of all possible values of the run-time parameters. The goal is that at run time, when the actual parameter values are known, the appropriate plan should be identifiable with essentially no overhead. We present a general formulation of this problem and study it primarily for the buffer size parameter. We adopt randomized algorithms as the main approach to this style of optimization and enhance them with a sideways information passing feature that increases their effectiveness in the new task. Experimental results of these enhanced algorithms show that they optimize queries for large numbers of buffer sizes in the same time needed by their conventional versions for a single buffer size, without much sacrifice in the output quality and with essentially zero run-time overhead."	#*Parametric Query Optimization. #@Yannis E.

In this paper, we discuss the main issues in performance tuning of such systems, namely striping and load balancing, and show their relationship to response time and throughput. We outline the main components of an intelligent, self-reliant file system that aims to optimize striping by taking into account the requirements of the applications, and performs load balancing by judicious file allocation and dynamic redistributions of the data when access patterns change. Our system uses simple but effective heuristics that incur only little overhead. We present performance experiments based on synthetic workloads and real-life traces."	#*Data Partitioning and Load Balancing in Parallel Disk Systems. #@Peter Scheuermann, Gerhard Weikum, Peter Zabback #t1998 #cVLDB J. #index53e99d96b7602d970264fda3 #%53e9981db7602d970203bb91 #%53e99a62b7602d97022cd193 #%53e99e93b7602d970275c562 #%53e9b4e4b7602d970400b223 #%53e99af2b7602d970237f901 #%53e9abcab7602d97035807b6 #%53e99b4ab7602d97023ee43e #%53e99a52b7602d97022b481d #%53e9b7d3b7602d9704384a57 #%53e9a138b7602d9702a25808 #%53e99cb5b7602d9702567b38 #%53e99ecbb7602d9702798098 #%53e99d0cb7602d97025bed38 #%53e9bdb3b7602d9704a60a11 #%53e9a416b7602d9702d32a7d #%53e9a011b7602d97028f5f5e #%53e9b381b7602d9703e63093 #%53e9b895b7602d97044688d6 #%53e9af46b7602d970398698d #%53e99d36b7602d97025ed1e2 #%53e9abdfb7602d97035989c7 #%53e99f63b7602d9702832d51 #%53e9a4ebb7602d9702e0bb09 #%53e9adb6b7602d97037b5ec5 #%53e99d1ab7602d97025ce775 #%53e9b4afb7602d9703fc0fa0 #%53e99cfdb7602d97025b4b4f #%53e9a6f5b7602d9703029d45 #%53e9a0d1b7602d97029b8cee #%53e9b677b7602d97041e19f5 #%53e9bd59b7602d97049f149f #%53e9a0cab7602d97029b60d2 #%53e9bdb2b7602d9704a5d764 #%53e997ecb7602d9701feaa05 #%53e998b8b7602d97020f2243 #%53e9b60eb7602d9704165b9a #%53e9b7adb7602d97043545f9 #%53e9b7d9b7602d970438c081 #%53e9b0abb7602d9703b1b802 #%53e9b036b7602d9703a93297 #%53e9b587b7602d97040c828b #%53e9b6dcb7602d970426c19d #%53e9bb66b7602d97047a6edb #%53e9b130b7602d9703bb2d7b #%53e99b95b7602d970243cbd0 #%53e99afdb7602d970238b35e #%53e9b388b7602d9703e66ba7 #%53e9adaab7602d97037a6d7d #%53e9a19ab7602d9702a8b9f7 #%53e9b4b4b7602d9703fc96be

However, despite the great potentials of making indexes smaller and faster, application of general compression methods to ordered data sets has advanced very little. This paper demonstrates that the fast dictionary-based methods can be applied to order-preserving compression almost with the same freedom as in the general case. The proposed new technology has the same speed and a compression rate only marginally lower than the traditional order-indifferent dictionary encoding. Procedures for encoding and generating the encode tables are described covering such order-related features as ordered data set restrictions, sensitivity and insensitivity to a character position, and one-symbol encoding of each frequent trailing character sequence. The experimental results presented demonstrate five-folded compression on real-life data sets and twelve-folded compression on Wisconsin benchmark text fields."	#*Dictionary-Based Order-Preserving String Compression. #@Gennady Antoshenkov #t1997 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b001b7602d9703a56e16 #%53e9988cb7602d97020c775d #%53e99827b7602d970204b1ad #%53e99f9cb7602d97028741f4

They have the potential to be long-lived, concurrently accessed, and consist of large bodies of data and programs. Typical examples of PASs are CAD/CAM systems, office automation, CASE tools, software engineering environments, and patient-care support systems in hospitals. Orthogonally persistent object systems are intended to provide improved support for the design, construction, maintenance, and operation of PASs. Persistence abstraction allows the creation and manipulation of data in a manner that is independent of its lifetime, thereby integrating the database view of information with the programming language view. This yields a number of advantages in terms of orthogonal design and programmer productivity which are beneficial for PASs. Design principles have been proposed for persistent systems. By following these principles, languages that provide persistence as a basic abstraction have been developed. In this paper, the motivation for orthogonal persistence is reviewed along with the above mentioned design principles. The concepts for integrating programming languages and databases through the persistence abstraction, and their benefits, are given. The technology to support persistence, the achievements, and future directions of persistence research are then discussed."	#*Orthogonally Persistent Object Systems #@Malcolm P.

Traditional data models and query languages do not provide appropriate support for this information. Such data are typically stored in file systems, which do not provide the security, integrity, or query features of database management systems. The hypertext model has emerged as a good interface to this information; however, finding information using hypertext browsing does not scale well. We developed a query interface that serves as an extension of the browsing model of hypertext systems. These queries minimize the repeated user interactions required to locate data in a standard hypertext system. HyperFile is a prototype data server interface.

In particular, we show here how such data can be queried and updated using declarative database languages. We introduce the notion of structuring schema, which consists of a grammar annotated with database programs. Based on a structuring schema, a file can be viewed as a database structure, queried and updated as such. For queries, we show that almost standard database optimization techniques can be used to answer queries without having to construct the entire database. For updates, we study in depth the propagation to the file of an update specified on the database view of this file. The problem is not feasible in general and we present a number of negative results. The positive results consist of techniques that allow to propagate updates efficiently under some reasonable locality conditions on the structuring schemas."	#*A Logical View of Structured Files. #@Serge Abiteboul, Sophie Cluet, Tova Milo #t1998 #cVLDB J. #index53e99be3b7602d970248c52b #%53e9be51b7602d9704b105fe #%53e9b8dab7602d97044bc04f #%53e9ab31b7602d97034bad78 #%53e9a216b7602d9702b17593 #%53e99827b7602d9702048eae #%53e9ba84b7602d97046a721c #%53e9b954b7602d97045433c1 #%53e9a6d0b7602d9703005dcc #%53e9a1e6b7602d9702ae39f5 #%53e9b8a8b7602d9704480ef1 #%53e9ad2db7602d970370fef4 #%53e9b0e6b7602d9703b5e9dc #%53e99854b7602d970208e97a #%53e9a3f4b7602d9702d09aa5 #%53e9ad3bb7602d970371db92 #%53e9a7c8b7602d9703109317

All operations including value-passing between SQL blocks can be set-oriented. By introducing partial evaluations, reordering operations can be achieved for nested queries. For a query using views, we merge CHGs for the views and the query into one CHG and then apply query optimization. Furthermore, we may simulate magic sets methods elegantly in a CHG. Sideways information-passing strategies (SIPS) in a CHG amount to partial evaluations of SIPS paths. We introduce the maximum SIPS strategy, which performs SIPS for all bindings and all SIPS paths for a query. The new method has several advantages. First, the maximum SIPS strategy can be more efficient than the previous SIPS based on simple heuristics. Second, it is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Third, the processing strategies may be incorporated with the search space for query execution plans, which is a proven optimization strategy introduced by System R. Fourth, it provides a general framework of query optimization and may potentially be used to optimize next-generation database systems."	#*Optimizing Relational Queries in Connection Hypergraphs: Nested Queries, Views, and Binding Propagations. #@Jia Liang Han #t1998 #cVLDB J. #index53e9aeeab7602d9703914595 #%53e9a70bb7602d9703042d0b #%53e9aef7b7602d9703928d85 #%53e99e3fb7602d9702705231 #%53e9b023b7602d9703a7f1ac #%53e9a3c7b7602d9702cdb419 #%53e9a7c8b7602d9703109317

Although semantic integrity constraints are usually much more static as compared to the data itself, changes in the data semantics may necessitate corresponding changes in the constraint base. In this paper we address the problems related with maintaining a consistent and non-redundant set of constraints satisfied by the database in the case of updates to the constraint base. We consider implication constraints as semantic integrity constraints. The constraints are represented as conjunctions of inequalities. We present a methodology to determine whether a constraint is redundant or contradictory with respect to a set of constraints. The methodology is based on the partitioning of the constraint base which improves the efficiency of algorithms that check whether a constraint is redundant or contradictory with respect to a constraint base."	#*Maintenance of Implication Integrity Constraints Under Updates to Constraints. #@Naci Ishakbeyoglu, Z.

We investigate algebraic query optimisation techniques for DBPLs in the context of a purely declarative functional language that supports sets as first-class objects. Since the language is computationally complete issues such as non-termination of expressions and construction of infinite data structures can be investigated, whilst its declarative nature allows the issue of side effects to be avoided and a richer set of equivalences to be developed. The language has a well-defined semantics which permits us to reason formally about the properties of expressions, such as their equivalence with other expressions and their termination. The support of a set bulk data type enables much prior work on the optimisation of relational languages to be utilised.In the paper we first give the syntax of our archetypal DBPL and briefly discuss its semantics. We then define a small but powerful algebra of operators over the set data type, provide some key equivalences for expressions in these operators, and list transformation principles for optimising expressions. Along the way, we identify some caveats to well-known equivalences for non-deductive database languages. We next extend our language with two higher level constructs commonly found in functional DBPLs: set comprehensions and functions with known inverses. Some key equivalences for these constructs are provided, as are transformation principles for expressions in them. Finally, we investigate extending our equivalences for the set operators to the analogous operators over bags. Although developed and formally proved in the context of a functional language, our findings are directly applicable to other DBPLs of similar expressiveness."	#*Algebraic Query Optimisation for Database Programming Languages #@Alexandra Poulovassilis, Carol Small #t1996 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b43db7602d9703f39c44 #%53e9b500b7602d970402f148 #%53e9b923b7602d970450e4af #%53e9b38eb7602d9703e6fcb9 #%53e997a2b7602d9701f76775 #%53e9ab31b7602d97034bad78 #%53e9bb08b7602d970473db01 #%53e9ba84b7602d97046a721c #%53e9b394b7602d9703e7573a #%53e99e8cb7602d97027563c1 #%53e9b7eeb7602d970439c1af #%53e9a797b7602d97030d0991 #%53e9a7c8b7602d9703109107 #%53e9a48eb7602d9702daf13b #%53e9b998b7602d97045886cc #%53e9acf6b7602d97036d42b2 #%53e9a38fb7602d9702c9de9a #%53e99893b7602d97020ccf66 #%53e9b54ab7602d97040843f0 #%53e9a593b7602d9702ebb764 #%53e9ab0eb7602d9703495507

However, there is no consensus on the most efficient data placement algorithm and placement is still performed manually by a database administrator with periodic reorganization to correct mistakes. This paper presents the first comprehensive simulation study of data placement issues in a shared-nothing system. The results show that current hardware technology trends have significantly changed the performance tradeoffs considered in past studies. A simplistic data placement strategy based on the new results is developed and shown to perform well for a variety of workloads."	#*Data Placement in Shared-Nothing Parallel Database Systems. #@Manish Mehta 0002, David J.

SORAC supports both semantic objects and relationships, and provides a tool for modeling databases needed for complex design domains. SORAC's set of built-in semantic relationships permits the schema designer to specify enforcement rules that maintain constraints on the object and relationship types. SORAC then automatically generates C++ code to maintain the specified enforcement rules, producing a schema that is compatible with Ontos. This facilitates the task of the schema designer, who no longer has to ensure that all methods on object classes correctly maintain necessary constraints. In addition, explicit specification of enforcement rules permits automated analysis of enforcement propagations. We compare the interpretations of relationships within the semantic and object-oriented models as an introduction to the mixed model that SORAC supports. Next, the set of built-in SORAC relationship types is presented in terms of the enforcement rules permitted on each relationship type. We then use the modeling requirements of an architectural design support system, called ArchObjects, to demonstrate the capabilities of SORAC. The implementation of the current SORAC prototype is also briefly discussed."	#*Data Model for Extensible Support of Explicit Relationships in Design Databases #@Joan Peckham, Bonnie MacKellar, Michael Doherty #t1995 #cVLDB J. #index53e9be64b7602d9704b25ae5 #%53e9a487b7602d9702da45c9 #%53e9ad26b7602d970370830a #%53e9abdfb7602d9703599a4d #%53e9ace8b7602d97036c3317 #%53e9baf1b7602d97047222f1 #%53e99e14b7602d97026da59c #%53e9ba32b7602d970463fc8b #%53e9aec4b7602d97038eaf20 #%53e99b2cb7602d97023c426a #%53e9b11db7602d9703b9aa88 #%53e9aa2bb7602d970339a2ab #%53e9bcc1b7602d9704940b8d #%53e9a9d9b7602d970333bd87 #%53e9a6ecb7602d970301fdf4 #%53e9a6cbb7602d970300144a #%53e9b895b7602d970446ebc4 #%53e99bfeb7602d97024a81f4 #%53e9bdacb7602d9704a5a57c #%53e9a627b7602d9702f57e73

These applications are far from being homogeneous, requiring different kinds of functionalities. However, most of the active DBMSs described in the literature only provide a fixed, hard-wired execution model to support the active dimension. In object-oriented DBMSs, event-condition-action rules have been propo sed for providing active behaviour. This paper presents EXACT, a rule manager for object-oriented DBMSs which provides a variety of options from which the designer can choose the one that best fits the semantics of the concept to be supported by rules. Due to the difficulty of foreseeing future requirements, special attention has been paid to making rule management easily extensible, so that the user can tailor it to suit specific applications. This has been borne out by an implementation in ADAM, an object -oriented DBMS.

Video data is unique not only in terms of its spatial and temporal characteristics, but also in the semantic associations manifested by the entities present in the video. This paper introduces a novel video data model called Logical Hypervideo Data Model. In addition to multilevel video abstractions, the model is capable of representing video entities that users are interested in (defined as hot objects) and their semantic associations with other logical video abstractions, including hot objects themselves. The semantic associations are modeled as video hyperlinks and video data with such property are called hypervideo. Video hyperlinks provide a flexible and effective way of browsing video data. Based on the proposed model, video queries can be specified with both temporal and spatial constraints, as well as with semantic descriptions of the video data. The characteristics of hot objects' spatial and temporal relations and efficient evaluation of them are also discussed. Some query examples are given to demonstrate the expressiveness of the video data model and query language. Finally, we describe a modular video database system architecture that our web-based prototype is based on."	#*Spatial and Temporal Content-Based Access to Hypervideo Databases. #@Haitao Jiang, Ahmed K.

Many corpora, such as internet directories, digital libraries, and patent databases are manually organized into topic hierarchies, also called taxonomies. Similar to indices for relational data, taxonomies make search and access more efficient. However, the exponential growth in the volume of on-line textual information makes it nearly impossible to maintain such taxonomic organization for large, fast-changing corpora by hand. We describe an automatic system that starts with a small sample of the corpus in which topics have been assigned by hand, and then updates the database with new documents as the corpus grows, assigning topics to these new documents with high speed and accuracy. To do this, we use techniques from statistical pattern recognition to efficiently separate the feature words, or discriminants, from thenoise words at each node of the taxonomy. Using these, we build a multilevel classifier. At each node, this classifier can ignore the large number of “noise” words in a document. Thus, the classifier has a small model size and is very fast. Owing to the use of context-sensitive features, the classifier is very accurate. As a by-product, we can compute for each document a set of terms that occur significantly more often in it than in the classes to which it belongs. We describe the design and implementation of our system, stressing how to exploit standard, efficient relational operations like sorts and joins. We report on experiences with the Reuters newswire benchmark, the US patent database, and web document samples from Yahoo!. We discuss applications where our system can improve searching and filtering capabilities."	#*Scalable Feature Selection, Classification and Signature Generation for Organizing Large Text Databases into Hierarchical Topic Taxonomies. #@Soumen Chakrabarti, Byron Dom, Rakesh Agrawal, Prabhakar Raghavan #t1998 #cVLDB J. #index53e99f42b7602d970281425a #%53e9ac70b7602d970364263e #%53e9b04eb7602d9703ab550d #%53e9a216b7602d9702b17593 #%53e9bb44b7602d970478494e #%53e9a885b7602d97031d506f #%53e9bc32b7602d97048a1ae1 #%53e99a1fb7602d9702273a30 #%53e9ab37b7602d97034c31ea #%53e9abb1b7602d970355bf0d #%53e9a18db7602d9702a820b9 #%53e99dabb7602d970266c163 #%53e9a894b7602d97031e356c #%53e9a93fb7602d9703294f33 #%53e997b9b7602d9701f9d968 #%53e9b8b3b7602d970448efd8 #%53e9b33eb7602d9703e148a1 #%53e9b360b7602d9703e3b313 #%53e9b98ab7602d9704579450 #%53e9b124b7602d9703ba665b

Navigational access is eased by hyperlink-rendition mechanisms going beyond plain link-integrity checking. With our approach, the database-internal representation of documents is configurable. It allows for an efficient implementation of operations, because DTD knowledge is not needed for document structure recognition.

Our approach combines the hB-tree, a multi-attribute index, and the $\\Pi$-tree, an abstract index which offers efficient concurrency and recovery methods. We call the resulting method the hB $^\\Pi$-tree. We describe several versions of the hB $^\\Pi$-tree, each using a different node-splitting and index-term-posting algorithm. We also describe a new node deletion algorithm. We have implemented all the versions of the hB $^\\Pi$-tree. Our performance results show that even the version that offers no performance guarantees, actually performs very well in terms of storage utilization, index size (fan-out), exact-match and range searching, under various data types and distributions. We have also shown that our index is fairly insensitive to increases in dimension. Thus, it is suitable for indexing high-dimensional applications. This property and the fact that all our versions of the hB $^\\Pi$-tree can use the $\\Pi$-tree concurrency and recovery algorithms make the hB $^\\Pi$-tree a promising candidate for inclusion in a general-purpose DBMS."	#*The hB-Pi-Tree: A Multi-Attribute Index Supporting Concurrency, Recovery and Node Consolidation. #@Georgios Evangelidis, David B.

We think that, in future, multimedia servers will also serve complete presentations. Multimedia presentations provide unique opportunities to develop algorithms for buffer management and admission control, as execution-time consumption requirements of presentations are known a priori. In this paper, we examine presentations in three different domains (heavyweight, middleweight, and lightweight) and provide buffer management and admission control algorithms for the three domains.

Recently, these so-called relational invariants were more precisely specified by the new SQL2 standard. Accordingly, they have to be guaranteed by a relational DBMS to its users and, therefore, all issues of semantics and implementation became very important. The specification of referential integrity embodies quite a number of complications including the MATCH clause and a collection of referential actions. In particular, $\\hbox{{\\tt MATCH PARTIAL}}$ turns out to be hard to understand and, if applied, difficult and expensive to maintain. In this paper, we identify the functional requirements for preserving referential integrity. At a level free of implementational considerations, the number and kinds of searches necessary for referential integrity maintenance are derived. Based on these findings, our investigation is focused on the question of how the functional requirements can be supported by implementation concepts in an efficient way. We determine the search cost for referential integrity maintenance (in terms of page references) for various possible access path structures. Our main result is that a combined access path structure is the most appropriatefor checking the regular MATCH option, whereas $\\hbox{{\\tt MATCH PARTIAL}}$ requires very expensive and complicated check procedures.

The algorithm obtains estimates for the number of page fetches for an index scan when given the number of tuples selected and the number of LRU buffers currently available. The algorithm has an initial phase that is performed exactly once before any estimates are calculated. This initial phase, involving LRU buffer modeling, requires a scan of all the index entries and calculates the number of page fetches for different buffer sizes. An approximate empirical model is obtained from this data. Subsequently, an inexpensive estimation procedure is called by the query optimizer whenever it needs an estimate of the page fetches for the index scan. This procedure utilizes the empirical model obtained in the initial phase."	#*Estimating Page Fetches for Index Scans with Finite LRU Buffers #@Arun N. Swami, K.

Conventional approaches for similarity search in databases map each object in the database to a point in some high-dimensional feature space and define similarity as some distance measure in this space. For many similarity search problems, this feature-based approach is not sufficient. When retrieving partially similar polygons, for example, the search cannot be restricted to edge sequences, since similar polygon sections may start and end anywhere on the edges of the polygons. In general, inherently continuous problems such as the partial similarity search cannot be solved by using point objects in feature space. In our solution, we therefore introduce extended feature objects consisting of an infinite set of feature points. For an efficient storage and retrieval of the extended feature objects, we determine the minimal bounding boxes of the feature objects in multidimensional space and store these boxes using a spatial access structure. In our concrete polygon problem, sets of polygon sections are mapped to 2D feature objects in high-dimensional space which are then approximated by minimal bounding boxes and stored in an R $^*$-tree. The selectivity of the index is improved by using an adaptive decomposition of very large feature objects and a dynamic joining of small feature objects. For the polygon problem, translation, rotation, and scaling invariance is achieved by using the Fourier-transformed curvature of the normalized polygon sections. In contrast to vertex-based algorithms, our algorithm guarantees that no false dismissals may occur and additionally provides fast search times for realistic database sizes. We evaluate our method using real polygon data of a supplier for the car manufacturing industry."	#*Using Extended Feature Objects for Partial Similarity Retrieval. #@Stefan Berchtold, Daniel A.

Examples of symbolic images include maps (where the semantic meaning of the symbols is given in the legend), engineering drawings, and floor plans. Two approaches for supporting queries on symbolic-image databases that are based on image content are studied. The classification approach preprocesses all symbolic images and attaches a semantic classification and an associated certainty factor to each object that it finds in the image. The abstraction approach describes each object in the symbolic image by using a vector consisting of the values of some of its features (e.g., shape, genus, etc.). The approaches differ in the way in which responses to queries are computed. In the classification approach, images are retrieved on the basis of whether or not they contain objects that have the same classification as the objects in the query. On the other hand, in the abstraction approach, retrieval is on the basis of similarity of feature vector values of these objects. Methods of integrating these two approaches into a relational multimedia database management system so that symbolic images can be stored and retrieved based on their content are described. Schema definitions and indices that support query specifications involving spatial as well as contextual constraints are presented. Spatial constraints may be based on both locational information (e.g., distance) and relational information (e.g., north of). Different strategies for image retrieval for a number of typical queries using these approaches are described. Estimated costs are derived for these strategies. Results are reported of a comparative study of the two approaches in terms of image insertion time, storage space, retrieval accuracy, and retrieval time."	#*Integrating Symbolic Images into a Multimedia Database System Using Classification and Abstraction Approaches. #@Aya Soffer, Hanan Samet #t1998 #cVLDB J. #index53e99cd8b7602d9702589aed #%53e9bcc1b7602d9704945289 #%53e9a501b7602d9702e24ee9 #%53e9b59ab7602d97040de4a2 #%53e9aec4b7602d97038ec4b1 #%53e9ae2eb7602d97038405e6 #%53e9a540b7602d9702e645c8 #%53e9ba39b7602d970464b327 #%53e9ab4fb7602d97034e5a70 #%53e9aa32b7602d970339f194 #%53e9b321b7602d9703decf92 #%53e9ae11b7602d970381e151 #%53e99ea0b7602d970276a77f #%53e9a09fb7602d970298626e #%53e99aedb7602d9702379932 #%53e99afeb7602d970238eee8 #%53e9a689b7602d9702fb9af7 #%53e9b395b7602d9703e7910d #%53e9b10fb7602d9703b8f4c2 #%53e9a690b7602d9702fc17e1 #%53e9b1b6b7602d9703c4672a

This paper argues that the “blackbox” ADTs used in current object-relational systems inhibit their performance, thereby limiting their use in emerging applications. Instead, the next generation of object-relational database systems should be based on enhanced abstract data type (E-ADT) technology. An (E-ADT) can expose the semantics of its methods to the database system, thereby permitting advanced query optimizations. Fundamental architectural changes are required to build a database system with E-ADTs; the added functionality should not compromise the modularity of data types and the extensibility of the type system. The implementation issues have been explored through the development of E-ADTs in Predator. Initial performance results demonstrate an order of magnitude in performance improvements."	#*Enhanced Abstract Data Types in Object-Relational Databases. #@Praveen Seshadri #t1998 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b349b7602d9703e1e680 #%53e99b7eb7602d9702424c31 #%53e9ac54b7602d9703625bed #%53e9a18db7602d9702a7e244 #%53e9a178b7602d9702a66d66 #%53e9ab38b7602d97034c8035 #%53e9a5d3b7602d9702eff900 #%53e9b885b7602d9704458386 #%53e9b36cb7602d9703e4dd9e #%53e9afb3b7602d97039ff677 #%53e99d87b7602d9702641e1d #%53e9b413b7602d9703f0b9b9 #%53e999cab7602d970220f707 #%53e9a885b7602d97031d5769 #%53e99d9db7602d9702657890 #%53e99d5db7602d97026181bb #%53e9ad2cb7602d970370d46a #%53e99833b7602d9702058253

The basic unit used in our technique is a single-colored cluster, which bounds a homogeneous region of that color in an image. Two clusters from two images are similar if they are of the same color and overlap in the image space. The number of clusters that can be extracted from an image can be very large, and it affects the accuracy of retrieval. We study the effect of the number of clusters on retrieval effectiveness to determine an appropriate value for “optimal'' performance. To facilitate efficient retrieval, we also propose a multi-tier indexing mechanism called the Sequenced Multi-Attribute Tree (SMAT). We implemented a two-tier SMAT, where the first layer is used to prune away clusters that are of different colors, while the second layer discriminates clusters of different spatial locality. We conducted an experimental study on an image database consisting of 12,000 images. Our results show the effectiveness of the proposed color-spatial approach, and the efficiency of the proposed indexing mechanism."	#*Fast Image Retrieval Using Color-Spatial Information. #@Beng Chin Ooi, Kian-Lee Tan, Tat-Seng Chua, Wynne Hsu #t1998 #cVLDB J. #index53e999aeb7602d97021f4833 #%53e9a2c0b7602d9702bc6cb2 #%53e9a98eb7602d97032eaafc #%53e9a0a6b7602d970299103e #%53e9b8a1b7602d97044794e1 #%53e997a2b7602d9701f77b31 #%53e9a4c7b7602d9702de89ed #%53e9bb72b7602d97047b415b #%53e9a4d7b7602d9702df8ed2 #%53e9a4c7b7602d9702de74d1 #%53e99aacb7602d9702328dca #%53e9b30ab7602d9703dd2d86 #%53e998c7b7602d9702101aa1 #%53e9a94cb7602d970329fa89 #%53e9996fb7602d97021b2b50 #%53e9afb4b7602d9703a04f0f #%53e9b716b7602d97042afc74 #%53e99924b7602d97021602a0 #%53e9ad72b7602d9703762dbf #%53e9a57cb7602d9702ea3f03 #%53e9ab89b7602d97035346e9

To speed up the access along inter-object references, the persistent pointers in the form of unique object identifiers (OIDs) are transformed (swizzled) into main-memory pointers (addresses). Pointer swizzling techniques can be divided into two classes: (1) those that allow replacement of swizzled objects from the buffer before the end of an application program, and (2) those that rule out the displacement of swizzled objects. The first class (i.e., techniques that take \"precautions\" for the replacement of swizzled objects) has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Four different pointer swizzling techniques allowing object replacement are investigated and compared with the performance of an object manager employing no pointer swizzling. The extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation---only part of which could be presented in this article---demonstrate that there is no one superior pointer swizzling strategy for all application profiles. Therefore, an adaptable object base run-time system is devised that employs the full range of pointer swizzling strategies, depending on the application profile characteristics that are determined by, for example, monitoring in combination with sampling, user specifications, and/or program analysis."	#*Adaptable Pointer Swizzling Strategies in Object Bases: Design, Realization, and Quantitative Analysis #@Alfons Kemper, Donald Kossmann #t1995 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b532b7602d97040682ab #%53e9a88cb7602d97031d74a0 #%53e9af7bb7602d97039c329a #%53e9b0d8b7602d9703b55fb1 #%53e9a381b7602d9702c8ecee #%53e9a343b7602d9702c4a3d1 #%53e9bde2b7602d9704a947cc #%53e9a101b7602d97029ecbd1 #%53e9af26b7602d97039608d3 #%53e9983db7602d9702063375 #%53e9b6a7b7602d970422477c #%53e9b6d0b7602d970425c305 #%53e99f86b7602d970285d67e #%53e9b672b7602d97041db1f5 #%53e9adffb7602d9703806e55 #%53e9b999b7602d970458b4e4 #%53e99bdcb7602d9702482c48 #%53e9a1c9b7602d9702ac13e5 #%53e9af88b7602d97039d18da #%53e9bd7bb7602d9704a20bb7 #%53e9b8eeb7602d97044d2872 #%53e99876b7602d97020af9c5 #%53e9b010b7602d9703a663ca #%53e999cab7602d970220c8b0 #%53e9a5f0b7602d9702f19e0f #%53e9af67b7602d97039a69be #%53e9a32eb7602d9702c36b23

In this paper many different algorithms that compute approximate solutions for optimizing join orders are studied since traditional dynamic programming techniques are not appropriate for complex problems. Two possible solution spaces, the space of left-deep and bushy processing trees, are evaluated from a statistical point of view. The result is that the common limitation to left-deep processing trees is only advisable for certain join graph types. Basically, optimizers from three classes are analysed: heuristic, randomized and genetic algorithms. Each one is extensively scrutinized with respect to its working principle and its fitness for the desired application. It turns out that randomized and genetic algorithms are well suited for optimizing join expressions. They generate solutions of high quality within a reasonable running time. The benefits of heuristic optimizers, namely the short running time, are often outweighed by merely moderate optimization performance."	#*Heuristic and Randomized Optimization for the Join Ordering Problem. #@Michael Steinbrunn, Guido Moerkotte, Alfons Kemper #t1997 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b2aab7602d9703d52b6b #%53e9a138b7602d9702a2a721 #%53e9aa7ab7602d97033f23e2 #%53e9b0a5b7602d9703b11615 #%53e9b6d0b7602d970425c305 #%53e9b179b7602d9703c01162 #%53e99f86b7602d970285d67e #%53e9b023b7602d9703a7f1ac #%53e99f86b7602d97028593a1 #%53e9ab97b7602d9703542bcf #%53e9b5a8b7602d97040ecfc3

We describe the multikey type index and an efficient implementation of this indexing scheme. It meets both requirements: in addition to its multiattribute query capabilities it is designed as a mediator between two standard design alternatives, key-grouping and type-grouping. A prerequisite for the multikey type index is a linearization algorithm which maps type hierarchies to linearly ordered attribute domains in such a way that each subhierarchy is represented by an interval of this domain. The algorithm extends previous results with respect to multiple inheritance. The subsequent evaluation of our proposal focuses on storage space overhead as well as on the number of disk I/O operations needed for query execution. The analytical results for the multikey type index are compared to previously published figures for well-known single-key search structures. The comparison clearly shows the superiority of the multikey type index for a large class of query profiles."	#*A Configrable Type Hierarchy Index for OODB. #@Thomas A. Mück, Martin L.

For this reason, and because concurrency control is a well-formulated problem, there has developed an enormous body of literature studying the performance of concurrency control algorithms. Most of this literature uses either analytic modeling or random number-driven simulation, and explicitly or implicitly makes certain assumptions about the behavior of transactions and the patterns by which they set and unset locks. Because of the difficulty of collecting suitable measurements, there have been only a few studies which use trace-driven simulation, and still less study directed toward the characterization of concurrency control behavior of real workloads. In this paper, we present a study of three database workloads, all taken from IBM DB2 relational database systems running commercial applications in a production environment. This study considers topics such as frequency of locking and unlocking, deadlock and blocking, duration of locks, types of locks, correlations between applications of lock types, two-phase versus non-two-phase locking, when locks are held and released, etc. In each case, we evaluate the behavior of the workload relative to the assumptions commonly made in the research literature and discuss the extent to which those assumptions may or may not lead to erroneous conclusions."	#*Analysis of Locking Behavior in Three Real Database Systems. #@Vigyan Singhal, Alan Jay Smith #t1997 #cVLDB J. #index53e9abdab7602d97035936f4 #%53e9af75b7602d97039ba999 #%53e9ab89b7602d9703535049 #%53e9b75ab7602d97042fa753 #%53e9b6c4b7602d9704251c90 #%53e9a381b7602d9702c8d7f1 #%53e9bd2ab7602d97049b8cae #%53e9ae49b7602d970385f8f1 #%53e99ea7b7602d970276f89b #%53e998bfb7602d97020f9aca #%53e9983db7602d970206972f #%53e9a0c9b7602d97029b032b #%53e9b587b7602d97040c828b #%53e9b443b7602d9703f3f8a5 #%53e9a439b7602d9702d56bb2 #%53e9af6eb7602d97039b2411 #%53e9be72b7602d9704b319ce #%53e9a281b7602d9702b848d2 #%53e9ab89b7602d970353596f #%53e99827b7602d970204942d

Each transaction always applies to the unique, current state of the system, resulting in a new current state. There are, however, complex applications where the system's state evolves into multiple lines of evolution. In general, this creates a tree (hierarchy) of evolution lines, where each tree node represents the time evolution of a particular subsystem. Multiple lines create novel historical queries, such as vertical or horizontal historical queries. The key characteristic of these problems is that portions of the history are shared; answering historical queries should not necessitate duplication of shared histories as this could increase the storage requirements dramatically. Both the vertical and horizontal historical queries have two parts: a \"search\" part, where the time of interest is located together with the appropriate subsystem, and a reconstruction part, where the subsystem's state is reconstructed for that time. This article focuses on the search part; several reconstruction methods, designed for single evolution lines can be applied once the appropriate time of interest is located. For both the vertical and the horizontal historical queries, we present algorithms that work without duplicating shared histories. Combinations of the vertical and horizontal queries are possible, and enable searching in both dimensions of the tree of evolutions."	#*Historical Queries Along Multiple Lines of Time Evolution #@Gad M.

We describe an approach which provides high concurrency while preserving well-formed trees across system crashes. Our approach works for a class of index trees that is a generalization of the B $^{\\rm link}$-tree. This class includes some multi-attribute indexes and temporal indexes. Structural changes in an index tree are decomposed into a sequence of atomic actions, each one leaving the tree well-formed and each working on a separate level of the tree. All atomic actions on levels of the tree above the leaf level are independent of database transactions, and so are of short duration. Incomplete structural changes are detected in normal operations and trigger completion."	#*Concurrency and Recovery for Index Trees. #@David B.

When the schema must evolve, some schema updates may violate these rules. In order to maintain behavioral schema consistency, traditional solutions require significant changes to the types, the type hierarchy and the code of existing methods. Such operations are very expensive in a database context. To ease schema evolution, we propose to support exceptions to the behavioral consistency rules without sacrificing type safety. The basic idea is to detect unsafe statements in a method code at compile-time and check them at run-time. The run-time check is performed by a specific clause that is automatically inserted around unsafe statements. This check clause warns the programmer of the safety problem and lets him provide exception-handling code. Schema updates can therefore be performed with only minor changes to the code of methods."	#*Type-safe Relaxing of Schema Consistency Rules for Flexible Modeling in OODBMS #@Eric Amiel, Marie-Jo Bellosta, Eric Dujardin, Eric Simon #t1996 #cVLDB J. #index53e9986eb7602d97020a9458 #%53e9ab6fb7602d970350df82 #%53e99ef4b7602d97027bef53 #%53e9ad72b7602d9703763b8d #%53e9b3e2b7602d9703ed2ca9 #%53e9b0a5b7602d9703b138f8 #%53e9af40b7602d970397dc63 #%53e9a0c3b7602d97029ad761 #%53e9be5db7602d9704b1e193 #%53e99800b7602d970200b445 #%53e99bcdb7602d9702478488 #%53e9b51bb7602d970404d4ae #%53e99f86b7602d970285d67e #%53e9bcd9b7602d970495dd1a #%53e9b436b7602d9703f2f31a #%53e9ad12b7602d97036f4788 #%53e99ee6b7602d97027b2d70 #%53e9b83fb7602d97043ff6d4

The costs of variations of several of the standard join algorithms, including nested block, sort-merge, GRACE hash and hybrid hash, are presented. For a given total buffer size, the cost of these join algorithms depends on the parts of the buffer allocated for each purpose. For example, when joining two relations using the nested block join algorithm, the amount of buffer space allocated for the outer and inner relations can significantly affect the cost of the join. Analysis of expected and experimental results of various join algorithms show that a combination of the optimal nested block and optimal GRACE hash join algorithms usually provide the greatest cost benefit, unless the relation size is a small multiple of the memory size. Algorithms to quickly determine a buffer allocation producing the minimal cost for each of these algorithms are presented. When the relation size is a small multiple of the amount of main memory available (typically up to three to six times), the hybrid hash join algorithm is preferable."	#*Join Algorithm Costs Revisited. #@Evan P.

One of the most important problems is that of integrity constraints satisfaction. The classic approach to this problem has been to develop methods for checking whether a given update violates an integrity constraint. An alternative approach consists of trying to repair integrity constraints violations by performing additional updates that maintain knowledge base consistency. Another major problem in knowledge base updating is that of view updating, which determines how an update request should be translated into an update of the underlying base facts. We propose a new method for updating knowledge bases while maintaining their consistency. Our method can be used for both integrity constraints maintenance and view updating. It can also be combined with any integrity checking method for view updating and integrity checking. The kind of updates handled by our method are: updates of base facts, view updates, updates of deductive rules, and updates of integrity constraints. Our method is based on events and transition rules, which explicitly define the insertions and deletions induced by a knowledge base update. Using these rules, an extension of the SLDNF procedure allows us to obtain all possible minimal ways of updating a knowledge base without violating any integrity constraint."	#*Updating Knowledge Bases While Maintaining Their Consistency #@Ernest Teniente, Antoni Olivé #t1995 #cVLDB J. #index53e9ae1cb7602d97038308cd #%53e99af2b7602d970238089d #%53e998efb7602d970212a0bb #%53e9b911b7602d97044f93d5 #%53e9a05fb7602d9702943fd0 #%53e9a202b7602d9702b00998 #%53e99db8b7602d970267b0c6 #%53e9984bb7602d97020804b1 #%53e9ba65b7602d97046832c8 #%53e99a2ab7602d97022832ff #%53e9ba32b7602d970463fc8b #%53e9be34b7602d9704aeed68 #%53e99a2ab7602d97022833bb #%53e9b755b7602d97042f9747 #%53e9a4cfb7602d9702ded747 #%53e9ae84b7602d97038a24a0 #%53e9b3d5b7602d9703ec4e1d #%53e9b7fcb7602d97043ae6be #%53e99af7b7602d9702383c37 #%53e99a86b7602d97022fd2da #%53e9b3bcb7602d9703ea3c90 #%53e9b954b7602d97045433c1 #%53e9a1e6b7602d9702ae39f5 #%53e9b5d4b7602d9704121a76 #%53e9b7b4b7602d970435be5b #%53e9b577b7602d97040b3b5e #%53e9bd7bb7602d9704a1de9a #%53e9b09fb7602d9703b07011 #%53e9a7c8b7602d9703109317

It has been recognized that many benefits can be gained by integrating real-time and active database technologies. However, not much work has been done in the area of transaction processing in real-time active databases. This paper deals with an important aspect of transaction processing in real-time active databases, namely the problem of assigning priorities to transactions. In these systems, time-constrained transactions trigger other transactions during their execution. We present three policies for assigning priorities to parent, immediate and deferred transactions executing on a multiprocessor system and then evaluate the policies through simulation. The policies use different amounts of semantic information about transactions to assign the priorities. The simulator has been validated against the results of earlier published studies. We conducted experiments in three settings: a task setting, a main memory database setting and a disk-resident database setting. Our results demonstrate that dynamically changing the priorities of transactions, depending on their behavior (triggering rules), yields a substantial improvement in the number of triggering transactions that meet their deadline in all three settings."	#*Priority Assignment in Real-Time Active Databases #@Rajendran M.

In many applications and situations, the order in which these clips are to be delivered does not matter that much to the user. This allows the system ample opportunities to optimize system throughput by using schedules that maximize the effect of piggybacking. In this paper, we study how to find such optimal schedules. In particular, we consider two optimization criteria: (i) one based on maximizing the number of piggybacked clips, and (ii) the other based on maximizing the impact on buffer space. We show that the optimal schedule under the first criterion is equivalent to a maximum matching in a suitably defined bipartite graph, and that under the second criterion, the optimal schedule is equivalent to a maximum matching in a suitably defined weighted bipartite graph. Our experimental results, which are based on realistic distributions, indicate that both kinds of optimal schedules can lead to a gain in throughput of over 300%. And yet the time taken to compute such an optimal schedule is negligible. Finally, we show how to deal with clips that are variable in length."	#*Optimal Clip Ordering for Multi-Clip Queries. #@Raymond T.

First, the two predominant deadlock models in these systems and the four different distributed deadlock detection approaches are discussed. Afterwards, a new deadlock detection algorithm is presented. The algorithm is based on dynamically creating deadlock detection agents (DDAs), each being responsible for detecting deadlocks in one connected component of the global wait-for-graph (WFG). The DDA scheme is a “self-tuning” system: after an initial warm-up phase, dedicated DDAs will be formed for “centers of locality”, i.e., parts of the system where many conflicts occur. A dynamic shift in locality of the distributed system will be responded to by automatically creating new DDAs while the obsolete ones terminate. In this paper, we also compare the most competitive representative of each class of algorithms suitable for distributed database systems based on a simulation model, and point out their relative strengths and weaknesses. The extensive experiments we carried out indicate that our newly proposed deadlock detection algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in the vast majority of configurations and workloads and, in contrast to all other algorithms, is very robust with respect to differing load and access profiles."	#*Deadlock Detection in Distributed Database Systems: A New Algorithm and a Comparative Performance Analysis. #@Natalija Krivokapic, Alfons Kemper, Ehud Gudes #t1999 #cVLDB J. #index53e9aa15b7602d97033803bf #%53e99ad1b7602d9702354e32 #%53e9b5a8b7602d97040f0437 #%53e9ac6ab7602d970363e4da #%53e9aa0fb7602d9703379635 #%53e9bb0eb7602d9704745427 #%53e9acb5b7602d9703691c66 #%53e9ab73b7602d97035188e7 #%53e9a635b7602d9702f65a8d #%53e9bc61b7602d97048d8f61 #%53e99997b7602d97021d933c #%53e9b4f4b7602d970401efa8 #%53e99959b7602d9702197a37 #%53e9a358b7602d9702c63d81 #%53e9bb1cb7602d9704755e58 #%53e9a65fb7602d9702f8e322 #%53e99a04b7602d97022503c3 #%53e99b56b7602d97023f95ea #%53e9abaab7602d97035565ff #%53e99804b7602d9702018352 #%53e9b587b7602d97040c828b #%53e99dccb7602d970268f71f #%53e9a6dfb7602d9703014e3d #%53e9b93fb7602d970452d4cb #%53e9b8e8b7602d97044c958e #%53e9b69db7602d9704210c9e #%53e9b7bab7602d9704362d16 #%53e9b5fab7602d970414b605 #%53e9ab78b7602d970351d31b #%53e99f94b7602d970286b5ec

At first, we give a detailed analysis of the kinds of structural heterogeneity that occur when unified views are derived from different database systems. We present the results in a multiple tier architecture which distinguishes different levels of heterogeneity and relates them to their underlying causes as well as to the mapping conflicts resulting from the view derivation process. As the second essential contribution, the paper presents our approach to a mapping language solving the identified conflicts. The main characteristics of the language are its descriptiveness, its capability to map between schemas written in the relational, object-oriented, ER, or EXPRESS data model, and its facilities for specifying user-defined update operations on the view that are to be propagated to the data sources. Finally, we briefly discuss how this mapping information is employed to convert queries formulated with respect to the integrated view, into database operations over the heterogeneous data sources."	#*The Intrinsic Problems of Structural Heterogeneity and an Approach to Their Solution. #@Theo Härder, Günter Sauter, Joachim Thomas #t1999 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b954b7602d970453e85b #%53e99db8b7602d970267b0c6 #%53e9b7eeb7602d97043a0e20 #%53e9a2acb7602d9702bb3936 #%53e9b755b7602d97042f9747 #%53e9b82eb7602d97043e66ef #%53e9ae6fb7602d970388f42a #%53e9aa48b7602d97033b798b #%53e9ab9eb7602d97035482a3 #%53e9bbeab7602d97048441e7 #%53e9abd4b7602d970358d392 #%53e9a232b7602d9702b3937c #%53e9b6d6b7602d9704265eb5 #%53e9ad81b7602d970377728d #%53e9accbb7602d97036a8f5c #%53e9aeebb7602d9703918d6c #%53e9ad68b7602d97037528fa #%53e998f0b7602d970212c60f #%53e9bc0ab7602d97048713de #%53e9bddbb7602d9704a8d602 #%53e9afb3b7602d97039ff677 #%53e9a4b2b7602d9702dd30d5 #%53e99fe9b7602d97028c717a #%53e9adaab7602d97037a6864 #%53e9a5beb7602d9702eebdba #%53e9a5f6b7602d9702f24dff #%53e9bde2b7602d9704a9049c #%53e9acdab7602d97036b4a5a

However, it is still a challenging task to design a cost-effective VOD system that can support a large number of clients (who may have different quality of service (QoS) requirements) and, at the same time, provide different types of VCR functionalities. Although it has been recognized that VCR operations are important functionalities in providing VOD service, techniques proposed in the past for providing VCR operations may require additional system resources, such as extra disk I/O, additional buffer space, as well as network bandwidth. In this paper, we consider the design of a VOD storage server that has the following features: (1) provision of different levels of display resolutions to users who have different QoS requirements, (2) provision of different types of VCR functionalities, such as fast forward and rewind, without imposing additional demand on the system buffer space, I/O bandwidth, and network bandwidth, and (3) guarantees of the load-balancing property across all disks during normal and VCR display periods. The above-mentioned features are especially important because they simplify the design of the buffer space, I/O, and network resource allocation policies of the VOD storage system. The load-balancing property also ensures that no single disk will be the bottleneck of the system. In this paper, we propose data block placement, admission control, and I/O-scheduling algorithms, as well as determine the corresponding buffer space requirements of the proposed VOD storage system. We show that the proposed VOD system can provide VCR and multi-resolution services to the viewing clients and at the same time maintain the load-balancing property."	#*Efficient Support for Interactive Service in Multi-Resolution VOD Systems. #@Kelvin Kwok-Wai Law, John C.

The algorithms are duals: Jive join range-partitions input relation tuple ids and then processes each partition, while Slam join forms ordered runs of input relation tuple ids and then merges the results. Both algorithms make a single sequential pass through each input relation, in addition to one pass through the join index and two passes through a temporary file, whose size is half that of the join index. Both algorithms require only that the number of blocks in main memory is of the order of the square root of the number of blocks in the smaller relation. By storing intermediate and final join results in a vertically partitioned fashion, our algorithms need to manipulate less data in memory at a given time than other algorithms. The algorithms are resistant to data skew and adaptive to memory fluctuations. Selection conditions can be incorporated into the algorithms. Using a detailed cost model, the algorithms are analyzed and compared with competing algorithms. For large input relations, our algorithms perform significantly better than Valduriez's algorithm, the TID join algorithm, and hash join algorithms. An experimental study is also conducted to validate the analytical results and to demonstrate the performance characteristics of each algorithm in practice."	#*Fast Joins Using Join Indices. #@Zhe Li, Kenneth A.

In order to support relational or object oriented applications on top of such a fragmented data model, a flexible yet powerful intermediate language is needed. This problem has been successfully tackled in Monet, a modern extensible database kernel developed by our group. We focus on the design choices made in the Monet interpreter language (MIL), its algebraic query language, and outline how its concept of tactical optimization enhances and simplifies the optimization of complex queries. Finally, we summarize the experience gained in Monet by creating a highly efficient implementation of MIL."	#*MIL Primitives for Querying a Fragmented World. #@Peter A. Boncz, Martin L.

One way to achieve such mediation between a local database and a remote database is to fold remote metadata into the local metadata, thereby creating a common platform through which information sharing and exchange becomes possible. Schema implantation and semantic evolution, our approach to the metadata folding problem, is a partial database integration scheme in which remote and local (meta)data are integrated in a stepwise manner over time. We introduce metadata implantation and stepwise evolution techniques to interrelate database elements in different databases, and to resolve conflicts on the structure and semantics of database elements (classes, attributes, and individual instances). We employ a semantically rich canonical data model, and an incremental integration and semantic heterogeneity resolution scheme. In our approach, relationships between local and remote information units are determined whenever enough knowledge about their semantics is acquired. The metadata folding problem is solved by implanting remote database elements into the local database, a process that imports remote database elements into the local database environment, hypothesizes the relevance of local and remote classes, and customizes the organization of remote metadata. We have implemented a prototype system and demonstrated its use in an experimental neuroscience environment."	#*Semantic Heterogeneity Resolution in Federated Databases by Metadata Implantation and Stepwise Evolution. #@Goksel Aslan, Dennis McLeod #t1999 #cVLDB J. #index53e9a62eb7602d9702f5ba5c #%53e9a002b7602d97028e4375 #%53e997b2b7602d9701f914a5 #%53e9bd50b7602d97049e10fb #%53e9b8cdb7602d97044b1a7c #%53e9b7eeb7602d97043a0e20 #%53e9a987b7602d97032e43db #%53e99d7ab7602d9702637ad6 #%53e9a618b7602d9702f4976a #%53e9ad81b7602d970377728d #%53e9b3a4b7602d9703e88cdc #%53e9b3fdb7602d9703eef4af #%53e9bddbb7602d9704a8d602 #%53e9b4b4b7602d9703fc7ba8 #%53e9a4b2b7602d9702dd3d1a #%53e9bdfdb7602d9704ab1679 #%53e9be80b7602d9704b416d6 #%53e9a987b7602d97032e53f0 #%53e9b01cb7602d9703a7690e #%53e99d4bb7602d9702600712 #%53e9a627b7602d9702f585dd #%53e9a034b7602d9702917ee6

Building an optimizer using OPT++ makes it easy to extend the query algebra (to add new query algebra operators and physical implementation algorithms to the system), easy to change the search space, and also to change the search strategy. Furthermore, OPT++ comes equipped with a number of search strategies that are available for use by an optimizer-implementor. OPT++ considerably simplifies both, the task of implementing an optimizer for a new database system, and the task of evaluating alternative optimization techniques and strategies to decide what techniques are best suited for that database system. We present the results of a series of performance studies. These results validate our design and show that, in spite of its flexibility, OPT++ can be used to build efficient optimizers."	#*OPT++: An Object-Oriented Implementation for Extensible Database Query Optimization. #@Navin Kabra, David J.

Currently, the most widely used striping scheme for CM data is round-robin permutation (RRP). Unfortunately, when RRP is applied to variable-bit-rate (VBR) CM data, load imbalance across multiple disks occurs, thereby reducing overall system performance. In this paper, the performance of a VBR CM server with RRP is analyzed. In addition, we propose an efficient striping scheme called constant time permutation (CTP), which takes the VBR characteristic into account and obtains a more balanced load than RRP. Analytic models of both RRP and CTP are presented, and the models are verified via trace-driven simulations. Analysis and simulation results show that CTP can substantially increase the number of clients supported, though it might introduce a few seconds/minutes of initial delay."	#*Constant Time Permutation: An Efficient Block Allocation Strategy for Variable-Bit-Rate Continuous Media Data. #@Yueh-Min Huang, Jen-Wen Ding, Shiao-Li Tsao #t1999 #cVLDB J. #index53e99b6ab7602d9702410cb2 #%53e9b4e4b7602d970400b223 #%53e99fb5b7602d9702891d94 #%53e9a6f5b7602d9703029d45 #%53e9bd0ab7602d9704990245 #%53e9ab69b7602d970350627b #%53e9ad26b7602d970370997f #%53e9aa6eb7602d97033e5f8d #%53e9b023b7602d9703a7e369 #%53e9b917b7602d97044fcfed #%53e9baadb7602d97046dbe5c #%53e9bc1bb7602d9704881fd6 #%53e9b600b7602d9704156bb1 #%53e9a051b7602d9702936cd3 #%53e999c3b7602d970220796c #%53e9a8c5b7602d9703213c43

The traditional blocking execution model can no longer meet the demands of these users. One promising approach in the literature, called online aggregation, evaluates an aggregation query progressively as follows: as soon as certain data have been evaluated, approximate answers are produced with their respective running confidence intervals; as more data are examined, the answers and their corresponding running confidence intervals are refined. In this paper, we extend this approach to handle nested queries with aggregates (i.e., at least one inner query block is an aggregate query) by providing users with (approximate) answers progressively as the inner aggregation query blocks are evaluated. We address the new issues pose by nested queries. In particular, the answer space begins with a superset of the final answers and is refined as the aggregates from the inner query blocks are refined. For the intermediary answers to be meaningful, they have to be interpreted with the aggregates from the inner queries. We also propose a multi-threaded model in evaluating such queries: each query block is assigned to a thread, and the threads can be evaluated concurrently and independently. The time slice across the threads is nondeterministic in the sense that the user controls the relative rate at which these subqueries are being evaluated. For enumerative nested queries, we propose a priority-based evaluation strategy to present answers that are certainly in the final answer space first, before presenting those whose validity may be affected as the inner query aggregates are refined. We implemented a prototype system using Java and evaluated our system. Results for nested queries with a level and multiple levels of nesting are reported. Our results show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms in providing progressive feedback that reduces the initial waiting time of users significantly without sacrificing the quality of the answers."	#*Progressive evaluation of nested aggregate queries. #@Kian-Lee Tan, Cheng Hian Goh, Beng Chin Ooi #t2000 #cVLDB J. #index53e9a45cb7602d9702d7891f #%53e9b008b7602d9703a63e41 #%53e9ade9b7602d97037f1417 #%53e99c7cb7602d970252b773 #%53e9a29db7602d9702ba4e51 #%53e99e3fb7602d9702705231 #%53e9ab4fb7602d97034e2188 #%53e9b1f1b7602d9703c86b76 #%53e9b3d5b7602d9703ec4208 #%53e9a704b7602d97030359ae #%53e9b873b7602d970444363f #%53e99f2db7602d97027fa549 #%53e9ab0db7602d970348f277

"#*Quantifiable data mining using ratio rules #@Flip Korn, Alexandros Labrinidis, Yannis Kotidis, Christos Faloutsos #t2000 #cThe VLDB Journal — The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases #index53908b4920f70186a0dbab1e #!Association Rule Mining algorithms operate on a data matrix (e.g., customers $\\times$ products) to derive association rules [AIS93b, SA96]. We propose a new paradigm, namely, Ratio Rules, which are quantifiable in that we can measure the “goodness” of a set of discovered rules. We also propose the “guessing error” as a measure of the “goodness”, that is, the root-mean-square error of the reconstructed values of the cells of the given matrix, when we pretend that they are unknown. Another contribution is a novel method to guess missing/hidden values from the Ratio Rules that our method derives. For example, if somebody bought $10 of milk and $3 of bread, our rules can “guess” the amount spent on butter. Thus, unlike association rules, Ratio Rules can perform a variety of important tasks such as forecasting, answering “what-if” scenarios, detecting outliers, and visualizing the data. Moreover, we show that we can compute Ratio Rules in a single pass over the data set with small memory requirements (a few small matrices), in contrast to association rule mining methods which require multiple passes and/or large memory. Experiments on several real data sets (e.g., basketball and baseball statistics, biological data) demonstrate that the proposed method: (a) leads to rules that make sense; (b) can find large itemsets in binary matrices, even in the presence of noise; and (c) consistently achieves a “guessing error” of up to 5 times less than using straightforward column averages."	#*Quantifiable Data Mining Using Ratio Rules. #@Flip Korn, Alexandros Labrinidis, Yannis Kotidis, Christos Faloutsos #t2000 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b93eb7602d970452a507

Instead, pair-wise distances between data objects are the only input. To support content-based retrieval, one approach maps each object to a k-dimensional (k-d) point and tries to preserve the distances among the points. Then, existing spatial access index methods such as the R-trees and KD-trees can support fast searching on the resulting k-d points. However, information loss is inevitable with such an approach since the distances between data objects can only be preserved to a certain extent. Here we investigate the use of a distance-based indexing method. In particular, we apply the vantage point tree (vp-tree) method. There are two important problems for the vp-tree method that warrant further investigation, the n-nearest neighbors search and the updating mechanisms. We study an n-nearest neighbors search algorithm for the vp-tree, which is shown by experiments to scale up well with the size of the dataset and the desired number of nearest neighbors, n. Experiments also show that the searching in the vp-tree is more efficient than that for the $R^*$-tree and the M-tree. Next, we propose solutions for the update problem for the vp-tree, and show by experiments that the algorithms are efficient and effective. Finally, we investigate the problem of selecting vantage-point, propose a few alternative methods, and study their impact on the number of distance computation."	#*Dynamic vp-Tree Indexing for n-Nearest Neighbor Search Given Pair-Wise Distances. #@Ada Wai-Chee Fu, Polly Mei-shuen Chan, Yin-Ling Cheung, Yiu Sang Moon #t2000 #cVLDB J. #index53e9bdf6b7602d9704aab9e4 #%53e9a98eb7602d97032eaafc #%53e9bb4bb7602d9704787d75 #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e9bb72b7602d97047b415b #%53e9b30ab7602d9703dd2d86 #%53e9a066b7602d970294d263 #%53e9b716b7602d97042afc74 #%53e9a1e2b7602d9702ae1fb5 #%53e9b0abb7602d9703b1978b #%53e9a540b7602d9702e645c8 #%53e9a8ffb7602d970325074e #%53e9a464b7602d9702d805a0 #%53e9afbab7602d9703a0b13a #%53e9b655b7602d97041b2707 #%53e9b1a9b7602d9703c33e40 #%53e9a272b7602d9702b76523 #%53e9acfeb7602d97036ddaf2 #%53e99d4cb7602d9702603dec #%53e9a074b7602d970295e95e #%53e9bb0eb7602d9704746aa9

However, little work has been carried out on multidimensional query optimization issues. Particularly the response time (or evaluation cost) for answering several related dimensional queries simultaneously is crucial to the OLAP applications. Recently, Zhao et al. first exploited this problem by presenting three heuristic algorithms. In this paper we first consider in detail two cases of the problem in which all the queries are either hash-based star joins or index-based star joins only. In the case of the hash-based star join, we devise a polynomial approximation algorithm which delivers a plan whose evaluation cost is $ O(n^{\\epsilon }$) times the optimal, where n is the number of queries and $ \\epsilon $ is a fixed constant with $0n times the optimal, and an exponential algorithm which delivers a plan with the optimal evaluation cost. We then consider a general case in which both hash-based star-join and index-based star-join queries are included. For this case, we give a possible improvement on the work of Zhao et al., based on an analysis of their solutions. We also develop another heuristic and an exact algorithm for the problem. We finally conduct a performance study by implementing our algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the solutions delivered for the restricted cases are always within two times of the optimal, which confirms our theoretical upper bounds. Actually these experiments produce much better results than our theoretical estimates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only development of polynomial algorithms for the first two cases which are able to deliver plans with deterministic performance guarantees in terms of the qualities of the plans generated. The previous approaches including that of [ZDNS98] may generate a feasible plan for the problem in these two cases, but they do not provide any performance guarantee, i.e., the plans generated by their algorithms can be arbitrarily far from the optimal one."	#*Optimizing Multiple Dimensional Queries Simultaneously in Multidimensional Databases. #@Weifa Liang, Maria E.

However, huge amounts of information available in the web come from databases or other data collections and are presented to the users in the form of dynamically generated pages. The query interfaces of such sites allow the specification of many search criteria. Their generated results support navigation to pages of results combining cross-linked data from many sources. For the analysis of visitor navigation behaviour in such web sites, we propose the web usage miner (WUM), which discovers navigation patterns subject to advanced statistical and structural constraints. Since our objective is the discovery of interesting navigation patterns, we do not focus on accesses to individual pages.

The two-phase commit protocol guarantees mutual consistency of replicated data but does not provide good performance. Lazy replication has been used as an alternative solution in several types of applications such as on-line financial transactions and telecommunication systems. In this case, mutual consistency is relaxed and the concept of freshness is used to measure the deviation between replica copies. In this paper, we propose two update propagation strategies that improve freshness. Both of them use immediate propagation: updates to a primary copy are propagated towards a slave node as soon as they are detected at the master node without waiting for the commitment of the update transaction. Our performance study shows that our strategies can improve data freshness by up to five times compared with the deferred approach."	#*Update Propagation Strategies to Improve Freshness in Lazy Master Replicated Databases. #@Esther Pacitti, Eric Simon #t2000 #cVLDB J. #index53e9abdfb7602d9703596db3 #%53e9ac6ab7602d970363e4da #%53e9ba95b7602d97046bbd2a #%53e9bb61b7602d970479f41e #%53e9a3dbb7602d9702cee165 #%53e9b0bcb7602d9703b2da1a #%53e9b077b7602d9703adeb04 #%53e9b587b7602d97040c828b #%53e9b102b7602d9703b82657 #%53e9b895b7602d970446f91f #%53e99fddb7602d97028b76cb #%53e99ab3b7602d970232ed2c #%53e9b47db7602d9703f82e4e #%53e9b2d7b7602d9703d88dd7 #%53e998bfb7602d97020fa23b

Efficient query processing requires an appropriate caching mechanism. Unfortunately, standard page-based as well as tuple-based caching mechanisms designed for conventional databases are not efficient on the Web, where keyword-based querying is often the only way to retrieve data. In this work, we study the problem of semantic caching of Web queries and develop a caching mechanism for conjunctive Web queries based on signature files. Our algorithms cope with both relations of semantic containment and intersection between a query and the corresponding cache items. We also develop the cache replacement strategy to treat situations when cached items differ in size and contribution when providing partial query answers. We report results of experiments and show how the caching mechanism is realized in the Knowledge Broker system."	#*Semantic Caching of Web Queries. #@Boris Chidlovskii, Uwe M.

The identification of outliers can lead to the discovery of truly unexpected knowledge in areas such as electronic commerce, credit card fraud, and even the analysis of performance statistics of professional athletes. Existing methods that we have seen for finding outliers can only deal efficiently with two dimensions/attributes of a dataset. In this paper, we study the notion of DB (distance-based) outliers. Specifically, we show that (i) outlier detection can be done efficiently for large datasets, and for k-dimensional datasets with large values of k (e.g., $k \\ge 5$); and (ii), outlier detection is a meaningful and important knowledge discovery task.First, we present two simple algorithms, both having a complexity of $O(k \\: N^2)$, k being the dimensionality and N being the number of objects in the dataset. These algorithms readily support datasets with many more than two attributes. Second, we present an optimized cell-based algorithm that has a complexity that is linear with respect to N, but exponential with respect to k. We provide experimental results indicating that this algorithm significantly outperforms the two simple algorithms for $k \\leq 4$. Third, for datasets that are mainly disk-resident, we present another version of the cell-based algorithm that guarantees at most three passes over a dataset. Again, experimental results show that this algorithm is by far the best for $k \\leq 4$. Finally, we discuss our work on three real-life applications, including one on spatio-temporal data (e.g., a video surveillance application), in order to confirm the relevance and broad applicability of DB outliers."	#*Distance-Based Outliers: Algorithms and Applications. #@Edwin M.

Visualizing the results of a dynamic multimedia query or materializing a dynamic multimedia view corresponds to assembling and delivering an interactive multimedia presentation in accordance with the visualization specifications. In this paper, we suggest that a non-interactive multimedia presentation is a set of virtual objects with associated spatial and temporal presentation constraints. A virtual object is either an object, or the result of a query. As queries may have different answers at different points in time, scheduling the presentation of such objects is nontrivial. We then develop a probabilistic model of interactive multimedia presentations, extending the non-interactive model described earlier. We also develop a probabilistic model of interactive visualization where the probabilities reflect the user profiles, or the likelihood of certain user interactions. Based on this probabilistic model, we develop three utility-theoretic based types of prefetching algorithms that anticipate how users will interact with the presentation. These prefetching algorithms allow efficient visualization of the query results in accordance with the underlying specification. We have built a prototype system that incorporates these algorithms. We report on the results of experiments conducted on top of this implementation."	#*View Management in Multimedia Databases. #@K. Selçuk Candan, Eric Lemar, V. S.

Users can see partial results and accordingly direct the processing by specifying preferences for various data items; data of interest is prioritized for early processing. The reordering mechanism is efficient and non-blocking and can be used over arbitrary data streams from files and indexes, as well as continuous data feeds. We also investigate several policies for the reordering based on the performance goals of various typical applications. We present performance results for reordering in the context of an online aggregation implementation in Informix and in the context of sorting and scrolling in a large-scale spreadsheet. Our experiments demonstrate that for a variety of data distributions and applications, reordering is responsive to dynamic preference changes, imposes minimal overheads in overall completion time, and provides dramatic improvements in the quality of the feedback over time. Surprisingly, preliminary experiments indicate that online reordering can also be useful in traditional batch query processing, because it can serve as a form of pipelined, approximate sorting."	#*Online dynamic reordering. #@Vijayshankar Raman, Bhaskaran Raman, Joseph M.

Current wrapper mediator architectures need to be extended with a wrapper cost model (WCM) for WebSources that can estimate the response time (delays) to access sources as well as other relevant statistics. In this paper, we present a Web prediction tool (WebPT), a tool that is based on learning using query feedback from WebSources. The WebPT uses dimensions time of day, day, and quantity of data, to learn response times from a particular WebSource, and to predict the expected response time (delay) for some query. Experiment data was collected from several sources, and those dimensions that were significant in estimating the response time were determined. We then trained the WebPT on the collected data, to use the three dimensions mentioned above, and to predict the response time, as well as a confidence in the prediction. We describe the WebPT learning algorithms, and report on the WebPT learning for WebSources. Our research shows that we can improve the quality of learning by tuning the WebPT features, e.g., training the WebPT using a logarithm of the input training data; including significant dimensions in the WebPT; or changing the ordering of dimensions. A comparison of the WebPT with more traditional neural network (NN) learning has been performed, and we briefly report on the comparison. We then demonstrate how the WebPT prediction of delay may be used by a scrambling enabled optimizer. A scrambling algorithm identifies some critical points of delay, where it makes a decision to scramble (modify) a plan, to attempt to hide the expected delay by computing some other part of the plan that is unaffected by the delay. We explore the space of real delay at a WebSource, versus the WebPT prediction of this delay, with respect to critical points of delay in specific plans. We identify those cases where WebPT overestimation or underestimation of the real delay results in a penalty in the scrambling enabled optimizer, and those cases where there is no penalty. Using the experimental data and WebPT learning, we test how good the WebPT is in minimizing these penalties."	#*Learning Response Time for WebSources Using Query Feedback and Application in Query Optimization. #@Jean-Robert Gruser, Louiqa Raschid, Vladimir Zadorozhny, Tao Zhan #t2000 #cVLDB J. #index53e99d3eb7602d97025f5b71 #%53e9b0a5b7602d9703b11615 #%53e9af06b7602d970393eff2 #%53e9a099b7602d9702982357 #%53e9a952b7602d97032a59c6 #%53e9a178b7602d9702a66d66 #%53e99b63b7602d97024058ae #%53e9b137b7602d9703bbbbdd #%53e9abf1b7602d97035ace6a #%53e9b44bb7602d9703f44f90 #%53e999cab7602d970220f707 #%53e9b3f6b7602d9703ee67ad #%53e9b80fb7602d97043c0431

During the past two decades, several dozen temporal data models have appeared, all with timestamps being integral components. The models have used timestamps for encoding two specific temporal aspects of database facts, namely transaction time, when the facts are current in the database, and valid time, when the facts are true in the modeled reality. However, with few exceptions, the assignment of timestamp values has been considered only in the context of individual modification statements.This paper takes the next logical step: It considers the use of timestamping for capturing transaction and valid time in the context of transactions. The paper initially identifies and analyzes several problems with straightforward timestamping, then proceeds to propose a variety of techniques aimed at solving these problems. Timestamping the results of a transaction with the commit time of the transaction is a promising approach. The paper studies how this timestamping may be done using a spectrum of techniques. While many database facts are valid until now, the current time, this value is absent from the existing temporal types. Techniques that address this problem using different substitute values are presented. Using a stratum architecture, the performance of the different proposed techniques are studied. Although querying and modifying time-varying data is accompanied by a number of subtle problems, we present a comprehensive approach that provides application programmers with simple, consistent, and efficient support for modifying bitemporal databases in the context of user transactions."	#*Effective Timestamping in Databases. #@Kristian Torp, Christian S.

We describe a simple and powerful query language based on pattern matching and show that it can be expressed using structural recursion, which is introduced as a top-down, recursive function, similar to the way XSL is defined on XML trees. On cyclic data, structural recursion can be defined in two equivalent ways: as a recursive function which evaluates the data top-down and remembers all its calls to avoid infinite loops, or as a bulk evaluation which processes the entire data in parallel using only traditional relational algebra operators. The latter makes it possible for optimization techniques in relational queries to be applied to structural recursion. We show that the composition of two structural recursion queries can be expressed as a single such query, and this is used as the basis of an optimization method for mediator systems. Several other formal properties are established: structural recursion can be expressed in first-order logic extended with transitive closure; its data complexity is PTIME; and over relational data it is a conservative extension of the relational calculus. The underlying data model is based on value equality, formally defined with bisimulation. Structural recursion is shown to be invariant with respect to value equality."	#*UnQL: A Query Language and Algebra for Semistructured Data Based on Structural Recursion. #@Peter Buneman, Mary F.

Main-memory access is therefore increasingly a performance bottleneck for many computer applications, including database systems. In this article, we use a simple scan test to show the severe impact of this bottleneck. The insights gained are translated into guidelines for database architecture, in terms of both data structures and algorithms. We discuss how vertically fragmented data structures optimize cache performance on sequential data access. We then focus on equi-join, typically a random-access operation, and introduce radix algorithms for partitioned hash-join. The performance of these algorithms is quantified using a detailed analytical model that incorporates memory access cost. Experiments that validate this model were performed on the Monet database system. We obtained exact statistics on events such as TLB misses and L1 and L2 cache misses by using hardware performance counters found in modern CPUs. Using our cost model, we show how the carefully tuned memory access pattern of our radix algorithms makes them perform well, which is confirmed by experimental results."	#*Optimizing database architecture for the new bottleneck: memory access. #@Stefan Manegold, Peter A.

The problem has recently received significant attention because of its relevance to a wide variety of data management problems. In query optimization, finding a rewriting of a query using a set of materialized views can yield a more efficient query execution plan. To support the separation of the logical and physical views of data, a storage schema can be described using views over the logical schema. As a result, finding a query execution plan that accesses the storage amounts to solving the problem of answering queries using views. Finally, the problem arises in data integration systems, where data sources can be described as precomputed views over a mediated schema. This article surveys the state of the art on the problem of answering queries using views, and synthesizes the disparate works into a coherent framework. We describe the different applications of the problem, the algorithms proposed to solve it and the relevant theoretical results."	#*Answering queries using views: A survey. #@Alon Y.

Virtually all personalization technologies are based on the idea of storing as much historical customer session data as possible, and then querying the data store as customers navigate through a web site. The holy grail of online personalization is an environment where fine-grained, detailed historical session data can be queried based on current online navigation patterns for use in formulating real-time responses. Unfortunately, as more consumers become e-shoppers, the user load and the amount of historical data continue to increase, causing scalability-related problems for almost all current personalization technologies. This paper chronicles the development of a real-time interaction management system through the integration of historical data and online visitation patterns of e-commerce site visitors. It describes the scientific underpinnings of the system as well as its architecture. Experimental evaluation of the system shows that the caching and storage techniques built into the system deliver performance that is orders of magnitude better than those derived from off-the-shelf database components."	#*An architecture to support scalable online personalization on the Web. #@Anindya Datta, Kaushik Dutta, Debra E.

It is essential to provide feedback so that users can visualize query reformulation alternatives and database content distribution. Since media matching is an expensive task, another issue is how to efficiently support exploration so that the system is not overloaded by perpetual query reformulation. In this paper, we present a uniform framework to represent statistical information of both semantics and visual metadata for images in the databases. We propose the concept of query verification, which evaluates queries using statistics, and provides users with feedback, including the strictness and reformulation alternatives of each query condition as well as estimated numbers of matches. With query verification, the system increases the efficiency of the multimedia database exploration for both users and the system.

As the number and variety of such applications grow, more business opportunities emerge for providing new services based on the integration and customization of existing applications. (Web shopping malls and support for comparative shopping are just a couple of examples.) Unfortunately, the diversity of applications in each specific domain and the disparity of interfaces, application flows, actor roles in the business transaction, and data formats, renders the integration and manipulation of applications a rather difficult task. In this paper we present the Application Manifold system, aimed at simplifying the intricate task of integration and customization of e-commerce applications. The scope of the work in this paper is limited to web-enabled e-commerce applications. We do not support the integration/customization of proprietary/legacy applications. The wrapping of such applications as web services is complementary to our work. Based on the emerging Web data standard, XML, and application modeling standard, UML, the system offers a novel declarative specification language for describing the integration/customization task, supporting a modular approach where new applications can be added and integrated at will with minimal effort. Then, acting as an application generator, the system generates a full integrated/customized e-commerce application, with the declarativity of the specification allowing for the optimization and verification of the generated application. The integration here deals with the full profile of the given e-commerce applications: the various services offered by the applications, the activities and roles of the different actors participating in the application (e.g., customers, vendors), the application flow, as well as with the data involved in the process. This is in contrast to previous works on Web data integration that focused primarily on querying the data available in the applications, mostly ignoring the additional aspects mentioned above."	#*Integrating and customizing heterogeneous e-commerce applications. #@Anat Eyal, Tova Milo #t2001 #cVLDB J. #index53e9a2b9b7602d9702bc02dc #%53e9a7c0b7602d97030fbd21 #%53e99838b7602d9702062921 #%53e997bdb7602d9701fa7946 #%53e9ab6fb7602d9703511a24 #%53e9ab73b7602d97035173c8 #%53e9ab26b7602d97034b2b76 #%53e99fc3b7602d97028a0792 #%53e9bc8eb7602d970490c761 #%53e9ab5fb7602d97034f7e1f #%53e999cab7602d970220f707 #%53e99a2fb7602d970228c7d5

As the use of XML becomes more widespread, we foresee the development of active XML rules, i.e., rules explicitly designed for the management of XML information. In particular, we argue that active rules for XML offer a natural paradigm for the rapid development of innovative e-services. In the paper, we show how active rules can be specified in the context of XSLT, a pattern-based language for publishing XML documents (promoted by the W3C) which is receiving strong commercial support, and Lorel, a query language for XML documents that is quite popular in the research world. We demonstrate, through simple examples of active rules for XSLT and Lorel, that active rules can be effective for the implementation of e-commerce services. We also discuss the various issues that need to be considered in adapting the notion of relational triggers to the XML context."	#*Active rules for XML: A new paradigm for E-services. #@Angela Bonifati, Stefano Ceri, Stefano Paraboschi #t2001 #cVLDB J. #index53e9af61b7602d97039a3042 #%53e9b029b7602d9703a88695 #%53e9b7b4b7602d970435b7ad #%53e9a3a5b7602d9702cb4ea0 #%53e9b3efb7602d9703edf1d9 #%53e99f94b7602d970286c9f9 #%53e9b246b7602d9703ce4922 #%53e9a44eb7602d9702d68ee1 #%53e9a0bbb7602d97029a1080 #%53e9a90db7602d970325d1f0 #%53e9ab5fb7602d97034f7e1f #%53e9a682b7602d9702fb5b38 #%53e9a6aeb7602d9702fe41fc #%53e9a922b7602d9703275cf9 #%53e9b0bcb7602d9703b2b679 #%53e9bc31b7602d970489fcdc

In current implementations, schema matching is typically performed manually, which has significant limitations. On the other hand, previous research papers have proposed many techniques to achieve a partial automation of the match operation for specific application domains. We present a taxonomy that covers many of these existing approaches, and we describe the approaches in some detail. In particular, we distinguish between schema-level and instance-level, element-level and structure-level, and language-based and constraint-based matchers. Based on our classification we review some previous match implementations thereby indicating which part of the solution space they cover. We intend our taxonomy and review of past work to be useful when comparing different approaches to schema matching, when developing a new match algorithm, and when implementing a schema matching component."	#*A survey of approaches to automatic schema matching. #@Erhard Rahm, Philip A.

In this paper, we present a key component of our system that characterizes the information content of a cell based on a user's prior familiarity with the cube and provides a context-sensitive exploration of the cube. There are three main modules of this component. A Tracker, that continuously tracks the parts of the cube that a user has visited. A Modeler, that pieces together the information in the visited parts to model the user's expected values in the unvisited parts. An Informer, that processes user's queries about the most informative unvisited parts of the cube. The mathematical basis for the expected value modeling is provided by the classical maximum entropy principle. Accordingly, the expected values are computed so as to agree with every value that is already visited while reducing assumptions about unvisited values to the minimum by maximizing their entropy.

They have been used successfully in applications involving money, and proprietary and personal data (such as banking, healthcare, insurance, etc.). As smartcards get more powerful (with 32-bit CPU and more than 1 MB of stable memory in the next versions) and become multi-application, the need for database management arises. However, smartcards have severe hardware limitations (very slow write, very little RAM, constrained stable memory, no autonomy, etc.) which make traditional database technology irrelevant. The major problem is scaling down database techniques so they perform well under these limitations. In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis of this problem and propose a PicoDBMS solution based on highly compact data structures, query execution without RAM, and specific techniques for atomicity and durability. We show the effectiveness of our techniques through performance evaluation."	#*PicoDBMS: Scaling down database techniques for the smartcard. #@Philippe Pucheral, Luc Bouganim, Patrick Valduriez, Christophe Bobineau #t2001 #cVLDB J. #index53e9abdab7602d9703592e01 #%53e9a620b7602d9702f50815 #%53e9a45cb7602d9702d78dfe #%53e99aecb7602d9702373ecc #%53e9a931b7602d9703285569 #%53e9bb9ab7602d97047e08a7 #%53e9ac6ab7602d970363e4da #%53e9a620b7602d9702f50815 #%53e9b587b7602d97040c828b #%53e9a45cb7602d9702d78dfe #%53e99aecb7602d9702373ecc #%53e9a931b7602d9703285569 #%53e9a7ddb7602d970311a0aa #%53e9ba17b7602d970461fe2d #%53e9abdab7602d9703592e01 #%53e9b3a3b7602d9703e86302 #%53e9bb9ab7602d97047e08a7

Enterprises can be buyers and sellers of products/services or participants of a complex supply chain engaged in purchasing, planning, and scheduling. Multiple copies of our server can be installed to complement the services of Web servers. Each enterprise can install or select a trusted negotiation server to represent his/her interests. Web-based GUI tools are used during the build-time registration process to specify the requirements, constraints, and rules that represent negotiation policies and strategies, preference scoring of different data conditions, and aggregation methods for deriving a global cost-benefit score for the item(s) under negotiation. The registration information is used by the negotiation servers to automatically conduct bargaining type negotiations on behalf of their clients. In this paper, we present the architecture of our implementation as well as a framework for automated negotiations, and describe a number of communication primitives which are used in the underlying negotiation protocol. A constraint satisfaction processor (CSP) is used to evaluate a negotiation proposal or counterproposal against the registered requirements and constraints of a client company. In case of a constraint violation, an event is posted to trigger the execution of negotiation strategic rules, which either automatically relax the violated constraint, ask for human intervention, invoke an application, or perform other remedial operations. An Event-Trigger-Rule (ETR) server is used to manage events, triggers, and rules. Negotiation strategic rules can be added or modified at run-time. A cost-benefit analysis component is used to perform quantitative analysis of alternatives. The use of negotiation servers to conduct automated negotiation has been demonstrated in the context of an integrated supply chain scenario."	#*An Internet-based negotiation server for e-commerce. #@Stanley Y.

In this paper, we take a fundamental look at how to approach query optimization from a top-down design perspective, rather than trying to force one model to fit into another. We present a graph model which is designed to characterize execution plans. Each edge and each vertex of the graph is assigned a weight to model execution plans. We also design algorithms that use these weights to optimize the execution order of operations. A cost model of these algorithms is developed. Experiments are conducted on the basis of this cost model. The results show that our algorithms are superior to similar work proposed in the literature."	#*A graph-theoretic model for optimizing queries involving methods. #@Chiang Lee, Chi-Sheng Shih, Yaw-Huei Chen #t2001 #cVLDB J. #index53e9bd46b7602d97049d67ae #%53e99e8cb7602d97027563c1 #%53e9a88cb7602d97031d7397 #%53e9b512b7602d9704046062 #%53e99ddab7602d9702699c3a #%53e9a569b7602d9702e8fe41 #%53e99ac4b7602d97023421ee #%53e9a5d3b7602d9702eff900 #%53e9be27b7602d9704ae1251 #%53e9ba28b7602d97046325dd #%53e9ad26b7602d970370b476 #%53e9bd46b7602d97049d77e9

It is not trivial to define a distance function that best mimics human visual perception regarding image similarity measurements. Reducing high-dimensional features in images using the popular principle component analysis (PCA) might not always be possible due to the non-linear correlations that may be present in the feature vectors. We propose in this paper a fast and robust hybrid method for non-linear dimensions reduction of composite image features for indexing in large image database. This method incorporates both the PCA and non-linear neural network techniques to reduce the dimensions of feature vectors so that an optimized access method can be applied. To incorporate human visual perception into our system, we also conducted experiments that involved a number of subjects classifying images into different classes for neural network training. We demonstrate that not only can our neural network system reduce the dimensions of the feature vectors, but that the reduced dimensional feature vectors can also be mapped to an optimized access method for fast and accurate indexing."	#*Combining multi-visual features for efficient indexing in a large image database. #@Anne H.

Different units of measure allow one to represent different granularities. Indeterminacy is often present in temporal information given at different granularities: temporal indeterminacy is related to incomplete knowledge of when the considered fact happened. Focusing on temporal databases, different granularities and indeterminacy have to be considered in expressing valid time, i.e., the time at which the information is true in the modeled reality. In this paper, we propose HMAP (The term is the transliteration of an ancient Greek poetical word meaning “day”.), a temporal data model extending the capability of defining valid times with different granularity and/or with indeterminacy. In HMAP, absolute intervals are explicitly represented by their start,end, and duration: in this way, we can represent valid times as “in December 1998 for five hours”, “from July 1995, for 15 days”, “from March 1997 to October 15, 1997, between 6 and 6:30 p.m.”. HMAP is based on a three-valued logic, for managing uncertainty in temporal relationships. Formulas involving different temporal relationships between intervals, instants, and durations can be defined, allowing one to query the database with different granularities, not necessarily related to that of data.

The key asset of this architecture is an XML mediator that handles the exchange of business and flow control data between workflow and business-object servers on the one hand and client activities on the other via XML messages over http. Our implementation of the mediator has made use of Oracle's XSQL servlet. The major benefit of the advocated architecture is that it provides seamless integration of client applications into e-service workflows with scalable efficiency and very little explicit coding, in contrast to an earlier, Java-based, version of our Mentor-lite prototype that required much more code and exhibited potential performance problems."	#*XML-enabled workflow management for e-services across heterogeneous platforms. #@German Shegalov, Michael Gillmann, Gerhard Weikum #t2001 #cVLDB J. #index53e9aa09b7602d970337634a #%53e9a7c0b7602d97030fbd21 #%53e9baa7b7602d97046d714b #%53e9ad2cb7602d970370cca3 #%53e9a79eb7602d97030dd9f6 #%53e9b661b7602d97041c64a9 #%53e9b81cb7602d97043d5767 #%53e9bd31b7602d97049bb267 #%53e998ceb7602d970210a405 #%53e9b655b7602d97041b1b7d #%53e9b5d4b7602d97041233b3 #%53e9b082b7602d9703aeae0c #%53e99df1b7602d97026b57d8 #%53e9ab4fb7602d97034e3b6f

In our system, mobile vehicles initiate time-constrained navigation requests and RTMonitor calculates and communicates the best paths for the clients based on the road network and real-time traffic data. The correctness of the suggested routes highly depends on how well the system can maintain temporal consistency of the traffic data. To minimize the overheads of maintaining the real-time data, RTMonitor adopts a cooperative and distributed approach using mobile agents which can greatly reduce the amount of communications and improves the scalability of the system. To minimize the space and message overheads, we have designed a two-level traffic graph scheme to organize the real-time traffic data to support navigation requests. In the framework, the agents use an Adaptive PUSH OR PULL (APoP) scheme to maintain the temporal consistency of the traffic data. Our experiments using synthetic traffic data show that RTMonitor can provide efficient support to serve navigation requests in a timely fashion. Although several agents may be needed to serve a request, the size of each agent is very small (only a few kilobytes) and the resulting communication and processing overheads for data monitoring can be maintained within a reasonable level."	#*RTMonitor: Real-Time Data Monitoring Using Mobile Agent Technologies. #@Kam-yiu Lam, Alan Kwan, Krithi Ramamritham #t2002 #cVLDB #index53e9b708b7602d970429b70d #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2fb3b #%53e99905b7602d970214452e #%53e99cb5b7602d9702568b3f #%53e9a62fb7602d9702f60341 #%53e9ac4eb7602d970362123f

Currently, a major obstacle for evaluating recommendation algorithms is the lack of any standard, public, real-world testbed appropriate for the task. In an attempt to fill this gap, we have created REFEREE, a framework for building recommender systems using ResearchIndex--a huge online digital library of computer science research papers--so that anyone in the research community can develop, deploy, and evaluate recommender systems relatively easily and quickly. Research Index is in many ways ideal for evaluating recommender systems, especially so-called hybrid recommenders that combine information filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. The documents in the database are associated with a wealth of content information (author, title, abstract, full text) and collaborative information (user behaviors), as well as linkage information via the citation structure. Our framework supports more realistic evaluation metrics that assess user buy-in directly, rather than resorting to offline metrics like prediction accuracy that may have little to do with end user utility. The sheer scale of ResearchIndex (over 500,000 documents with thousands of user accesses per hour) will force algorithm designers to make real-world trade-offs that consider performance, not just accuracy. We present our own tradeoff decisions in building an example hybrid recommender called PD-Live. The algorithm uses content-based similarity information to select a set of documents from which to recommend, and collaborative information to rank the documents. PD-Live performs reasonably well compared to other recommenders in ResearchIndex."	#*REFEREE: An Open Framework for Practical Testing of Recommender Systems using ResearchIndex. #@Dan Cosley, Steve Lawrence, David M.

As companies transact business over the Internet, the sensitive nature of the information mandates that access must be provided selectively, using sophisticated access control specifications. Using the specification directly to determine if a user has access to a specific XML data item can hence be extremely inefficient. The alternative of fully materializing, for each data item, the users authorized to access it can be space-inefficient. In this paper, we propose a space- and time-efficient solution to the access control problem for XML data. Our solution is based on a novel notion of a compressed accessibility map (CAM), which compactly identifies the XML data items to which a user has access, by exploiting structural locality of accessibility in tree-structured data. We present a CAM lookup algorithm for determining if a user has access to a data item; it takes time proportional to the product of the depth of the item in the XML data and logarithm of the CAM size."	#*Compressed Accessibility Map: Efficient Access Control for XML. #@Ting Yu, Divesh Srivastava, Laks V.

Following a long tradition in database research, we provide a framework to assess the abilities of an XML database to cope with a broad range of different query types typically encountered in real-world scenarios. The benchmark can help both implementors and users to compare XML databases in a standardized application scenario. To this end, we offer a set of queries where each query is intended to challenge a particular aspect of the query processor. The overall workload we propose consists of a scalable document database and a concise, yet comprehensive set of queries which covers the major aspects of XML query processing ranging from textual features to data analysis queries and ad hoc queries. We complement our research with results we obtained from running the benchmark on several XML database platforms.

This paper gives an in-depth analysis of existing security solutions and concludes on the intrinsic weakness of the traditional server-based approach to preserve data confidentiality. With this statement in mind, we propose a solution called C-SDA (Chip-Secured Data Access), which enforces data confidentiality and controls personal privileges thanks to a client-based security component acting as a mediator between a client and an encrypted database. This component is embedded in a smartcard to prevent any tampering to occur. This cooperation of hardware and software security components constitutes a strong guarantee against attacks threatening personal as well as business data."	#*Chip-Secured Data Access: Confidential Data on Untrusted Servers. #@Luc Bouganim, Philippe Pucheral #t2002 #cVLDB #index53e99b94b7602d9702439f10 #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2fb3b #%53e9b6dbb7602d970426afe0 #%53e9a263b7602d9702b6a15a #%53e9a45cb7602d9702d78dfe #%53e9b7c1b7602d970436c246 #%53e9b607b7602d970415b4f6 #%53e9abdab7602d9703592e01 #%53e9aab7b7602d97034336f3 #%53e9bb9ab7602d97047e08a7

For example, Internet routers produce large scale diagnostic data streams. Such streams are rarely stored in traditional databases, and instead must be processed \"on the fly\" as they are produced. Similarly, sensor networks produce multiple data streams of observations from their sensors. There is growing focus on manipulating data streams, and hence, there is a need to identify basic operations of interest in managing data streams, and to support them efficiently. We propose computation of the Hamming norm as a basic operation of interest. The Hamming norm formalises ideas that are used throughout data processing. When applied to a single stream, the Hamming norm gives the number of distinct items that are present in that data stream, which is a statistic of great interest in databases. When applied to a pair of streams, the Hamming norm gives an important measure of (dis)similarity: the number of unequal item counts in the two streams. Hamming norms have many uses in comparing data streams. We present a novel approximation technique for estimating the Hamming norm for massive data streams; this relies on what we call the \"l0 sketch\" and we prove its accuracy. We test our approximation method on a large quantity of synthetic and real stream data, and show that the estimation is accurate to within a few percentage points."	#*Comparing Data Streams Using Hamming Norms (How to Zero In). #@Graham Cormode, Mayur Datar, Piotr Indyk, S.

At present, it is difficult for XQuery to type and optimize structurally recursive queries because of polymorphic recursive functions involved in the queries. In this paper, we propose a new technique called structural function inlining which inlines recursive functions used in a query by making good use of available type information. Based on the technique, we develop a new approach to typing and optimizing structurally recursive queries. The new approach yields a more precise result type for a query. Furthermore, it produces an optimal algebraic expression for the query with respect to the type information. When a structurally recursive query is applied to non-recursive XML data, our approach translates the query into a finitely nested iterations. We conducted several experiments with commonly used real-life and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that the number of node lookups by our approach is on the average 3.7 times and up to 279.8 times smaller than that by the XQuery core's current approach in evaluating structurally recursive queries."	#*Structural Function Inlining Technique for Structurally Recursive XML Queries. #@Chang-Won Park, Jun-Ki Min, Chin-Wan Chung #t2002 #cVLDB #index53e9bb4bb7602d97047886bd #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2fb3b #%53e99a4eb7602d97022ae0d6 #%53e9ada5b7602d97037a5b84 #%53e9b413b7602d9703f0b9b9 #%53e9989bb7602d97020d5003 #%53e9ac28b7602d97035ea67a

In addition to single stream statistics such as average and standard deviation, we also want to find high correlations among all pairs of streams. A stock market trader might use such a tool to spot arbitrage opportunities. This paper proposes efficient methods for solving this problem based on Discrete Fourier Transforms and a three level time interval hierarchy. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real world financial trading data show that our algorithm beats the direct computation approach by several orders of magnitude. It also improves on previous Fourier Transform approaches by allowing the efficient computation of time-delayed correlation over any size sliding window and any time delay. Correlation also lends itself to an efficient grid-based data structure. The result is the first algorithm that we know of to compute correlations over thousands of data streams in real time. The algorithm is incremental, has fixed response time, and can monitor the pairwise correlations of 10,000 streams on a single PC. The algorithm is embarrassingly parallelizable."	#*StatStream: Statistical Monitoring of Thousands of Data Streams in Real Time. #@Yunyue Zhu, Dennis Shasha #t2002 #cVLDB #index53e9bb22b7602d970475b243 #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2fb3b #%53e9b145b7602d9703bc86e8 #%53e9b4e0b7602d9704006b0c #%53e9ac21b7602d97035e03a8 #%53e9b055b7602d9703ab8cf1 #%53e9bb8cb7602d97047d50ee #%53e9b4abb7602d9703fbd362 #%53e9b179b7602d9703c00991 #%53e9aab0b7602d97034285b3 #%53e9ac7bb7602d97036524b7 #%53e99f42b7602d9702810ff0 #%53e9bc4eb7602d97048c57b4 #%53e998f6b7602d9702136b34 #%53e9bd31b7602d97049bc391 #%53e99809b7602d9702020cce #%53e9be3cb7602d9704afa75f #%53e99fd6b7602d97028b0194

They are accurate, robust, and quick to apply to test instances. Their only potential drawback is their training time and memory requirement. For n training instances held in memory, the best-known SVM implementations take time proportional to na, where a is typically between 1.8 and 2.1. SVMs have been trained on data sets with several thousand instances, but Web directories today contain millions of instances which are valuable for mapping billions of Web pages into Yahoo!-like directories. We present SIMPL, a nearly linear-time classification algorithm which mimics the strengths of SVMs while avoiding the training bottleneck. It uses Fisher's linear discriminant, a classical tool from statistical pattern recognition, to project training instances to a carefully selected low-dimensional subspace before inducing a decision tree on the projected instances. SIMPL uses efficient sequential scans and sorts, and is comparable in speed and memory scalability to widely-used naive Bayes (NB) classifiers, but it beats NB accuracy decisively. It not only approaches and sometimes exceeds SVM accuracy, but also beats SVM running time by orders of magnitude. While developing SIMPL, we also make a detailed experimental analysis of the cache performance of SVMs."	#*Fast and Accurate Text Classification via Multiple Linear Discriminant Projections. #@Soumen Chakrabarti, Shourya Roy, Mahesh V.

Thus, these techniques start producing first results only after a considerable time period has passed. This blocking behaviour is a serious problem when consequent operators have to stop processing, in order to wait for first results of the join. Furthermore, this behaviour is not acceptable if the result of the join is visualized or/ and requires user interaction. These are typical scenarios for data mining applications. The, off-time' of existing techniques even increases with growing problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a generic technique called Progressive Merge Join (PMJ) that eliminates the blocking behaviour of sort-based join algorithms. The basic idea behind PMJ is to have the join produce results, as early as the external mergesort generates initial runs. Hence, it is possible for PMJ to return first results very early. This paper provides the basic algorithms and the generic framework of PMJ, as well as use-cases for different types of joins. Moreover, we provide a generic online selectivity estimator with probabilistic quality guarantees. For similarity joins in particular, first non-blocking join algorithms are derived from applying PMJ to the state-of-the-art techniques. We have implemented PMJ as part of an object-relational cursor algebra. A set of experiments shows that a substantial amount of results are produced, even before the input relationas would have been sorted. We observed only a moderate increase in the total runtime compared to the blocking counterparts."	#*Progressive Merge Join: A Generic and Non-blocking Sort-based Join Algorithm. #@Jens-Peter Dittrich, Bernhard Seeger, David Scot Taylor, Peter Widmayer #t2002 #cVLDB #index53e99b43b7602d97023e3b29 #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2fb3b #%53e999ffb7602d970224bf32 #%53e99d8fb7602d970264c5be #%53e9ade9b7602d97037f1417 #%53e9b4a0b7602d9703fa9407 #%53e99e5bb7602d9702722811 #%53e9a1a1b7602d9702a9485f #%53e99ec4b7602d970278deeb #%53e99ab8b7602d9702331d17 #%53e9b0e6b7602d9703b5ed3f #%53e9b34ab7602d9703e23a05 #%53e9afa0b7602d97039ed94a #%53e9badfb7602d970470e622 #%53e999e7b7602d970222ddbf #%53e9bc79b7602d97048fb5c5

Metasearchers are helpful tools for searching over many such databases at once through a unified query interface. A critical task for a metasearcher to process a query efficiently and effectively is the selection of the most promising databases for the query, a task that typically relies on statistical summaries of the database contents. Unfortunately, web-accessible text databases do not generally export content summaries. In this paper, we present an algorithm to derive content summaries from \"uncooperative\" databases by using \"focused query probes,\" which adaptively zoom in on and extract documents that are representative of the topic coverage of the databases. Our content summaries are the first to include absolute document frequency estimates for the database words. We also present a novel database selection algorithm that exploits both the extracted content summaries and a hierarchical classification of the databases, automatically derived during probing, to compensate for potentially incomplete content summaries. Finally, we evaluate our techniques thoroughly using a variety of databases, including 50 real web-accessible text databases. Our experiments indicate that our new content-summary construction technique is efficient and produces more accurate summaries than those from previously proposed strategies. Also, our hierarchical database selection algorithm exhibits significantly higher precision than its flat counterparts."	#*Distributed Search over the Hidden Web: Hierarchical Database Sampling and Selection. #@Panagiotis G.

OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) databases of this size are hard to maintain and tend to perform poorly. Therefore most database vendors have implemented new features like horizontal partitioning to optimize such mission critical applications. Horizontal partitioning was already investigated in detail in the context of shared nothing distributed database systems but today's ERP systems mostly use a centralized database with a shared everything architecture. In this work, we therefore investigate how an SAP R/3 system performs when the data in the underlying database is partitioned horizontally. Our results show that especially joins, in parallel executed statements, and administrative tasks benefit greatly from horizontal partitioning while the resulting small increase in the execution times of insertions, deletions and updates is tolerable. These positive results have initiated the SAP cooperation partners to pursue a partitioned data layout in some of their largest installed productive systems."	#*Experience Report: Exploiting Advanced Database Optimization Features for Large-Scale SAP R/3 Installations. #@Bernhard Zeller, Alfons Kemper #t2002 #cVLDB #index53e9a689b7602d9702fbe6bb #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2fb3b #%53e9b7d3b7602d9704384a57 #%53e9a7ebb7602d970312e103 #%53e9a50eb7602d9702e2e7ce #%53e9b5b6b7602d97040fc4ed #%53e9aa56b7602d97033c516c #%53e9bba1b7602d97047e86e1 #%53e9bb2fb7602d970476c364 #%53e9a603b7602d9702f33aec #%53e9aecbb7602d97038f67cf #%53e99d96b7602d970264fda3 #%53e9a8f8b7602d97032459aa

Updates, insertions, and deletions of data objects in autonomous information systems often have to trigger data changes in other autonomous systems, even if the distributed systems are not integrated into a global schema. We suggest a solution to this problem based on the propagation and transformation of data using several XML technologies. Our prototype manages dependencies between the schemas of distributed data sources and allows to define and process arbitrary actions on changed data by manipulating all dependent data sources. The prototype comprises a propagation engine that interprets scripts based on a workflow specification language, a data dependency specification tool, a system administration tool, and a repository that stores all relevant information for these tools."	#*Champagne: Data Change Propagation for Heterogeneous Information Systems. #@Ralf Rantzau, Carmen Constantinescu, Uwe Heinkel, Holger Meinecke #t2002 #cVLDB #index53e99959b7602d9702199fc1 #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2fb3b #%53e99b77b7602d970241cfa8

For example, they are useful in selectivity estimation during query optimization, in partitioning large relations, in estimating query result sizes when building user interfaces, and in characterizing the data distribution of evolving datasets in the process of data mining. We present a new algorithm for dynamically computing quantiles of a relation subject to insert as well as delete operations. The algorithm monitors the operations and maintains a simple, small-space representation (based on random subset sums or RSSs) of the underlying data distribution. Using these RSSs, we can quickly estimate, without having to access the data, all the quantiles, each guaranteed to be accurate to within user-specified precision. Previously-known one-pass quantile estimation algorithms that provide similar quality and performance guarantees can not handle deletions. Other algorithms that can handle delete operations cannot guarantee performance without rescanning the entire database. We present the algorithm, its theoretical performance analysis and extensive experimental results with synthetic and real datasets. Independent of the rates of insertions and deletions, our algorithm is remarkably precise at estimating quantiles in small space, as our experiments demonstrate."	#*How to Summarize the Universe: Dynamic Maintenance of Quantiles. #@Anna C.

This paper presents a Probabilistic Tree Data Base (ProTDB) to manage probabilistic data, represented in XML. Our approach differs from previous efforts to develop probabilistic relational systems in that we build a probabilistic XML database. This design is driven by application needs that involve data not readily amenable to a relational representation. XML data poses several modeling challenges: due to its structure, due to the possibility of uncertainty association at multiple granularities, and due to the possibility of missing and repeated sub-elements. We present a probabilistic XML model that addresses all of these challenges. We devise an implementation of XML query operations using our probability model, and demonstrate the efficiency of our implementation experimentally. We have used ProTDB to manage data from two application areas: protein chemistry data from the bioinformatics domain, and information extraction data obtained from the web using a natural language analysis system. We present a brief case study of the latter to demonstrate the value of probabilistic XML data management."	#*ProTDB: Probabilistic Data in XML. #@Andrew Nierman, H. V.

Skyline queries retrieve all such interesting restaurants so that the user can choose the most promising one. In this paper, we present a new online algorithm that computes the Skyline. Unlike most existing algorithms that compute the Skyline in a batch, this algorithm returns the first results immediately, produces more and more results continuously, and allows the user to give preferences during the running time of the algorithm so that the user can control what kind of results are produced next (e.g., rather cheap or rather near restaurants)."	#*Shooting Stars in the Sky: An Online Algorithm for Skyline Queries. #@Donald Kossmann, Frank Ramsak, Steffen Rost #t2002 #cVLDB #index53e9bddbb7602d9704a89971 #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2fb3b #%53e999ffb7602d970224bf32 #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e9ac70b7602d97036425c6 #%53e99f86b7602d970285a5d7 #%53e9adc7b7602d97037ce5c4 #%53e9ae63b7602d970387d038 #%53e9984fb7602d9702085753

Many of these applications have to manage huge databases of RE specifications and need to provide an effective matching mechanism that, given an input string, quickly identifies the REs in the database that match it. In this paper, we propose the RE-tree, a novel index structure for large databases of RE specifications. Given an input query string, the RE-tree speeds up the retrieval of matching REs by focusing the search and comparing the input string with only a small fraction of REs in the database. Even though the RE-tree is similar in spirit to other tree-based structures that have been proposed for indexing multi-dimensional data, RE indexing is significantly more challenging since REs typically represent infinite sets of strings with no well-defined notion of spatial locality. To address these new challenges, our RE-tree index structure relies on novel measures for comparing the relative sizes of infinite regular languages. We also propose innovative solutions for the various RE-tree operations, including the effective splitting of RE-tree nodes and computing a \"tight\" bounding RE for a collection of REs. Finally, we demonstrate how sampling-based approximation algorithms can be used to significantly speed up the performance of RE-tree operations. Our experimental results with synthetic data sets indicate that the REtree is very effective in pruning the search space and easily outperforms naive sequential search approaches."	#*RE-Tree: An Efficient Index Structure for Regular Expressions. #@Chee Yong Chan, Minos N.

The system compiles a given XQuery into an XSM, which is an XML stream transducer, i.e., an abstract device that takes as input one or more XML data streams and produces one or more output streams, potentially using internal buffers. We present a systematic way to translate XQueries into efficient XSMs: First the XQuery is translated into a network of XSMs that correspond to the basic operators of the XQuery language and exchange streams. The network is reduced to a single XSM by repeated application of an XSM composition operation that is optimized to reduce the number of tests and actions that the XSM performs as well as the number of intermediate buffers that it uses. Finally, the optimized XSM is compiled into a C program.

DISCOVER returns qualified joining networks of tuples, that is, sets of tuples that are associated because they join on their primary and foreign keys and collectively contain all the keywords of the query. DISCOVER proceeds in two steps. First the Candidate Network Generator generates all candidate networks of relations, that is, join expressions that generate the joining networks of tuples. Then the Plan Generator builds plans for the efficient evaluation of the set of candidate networks, exploiting the opportunities to reuse common subexpressions of the candidate networks. We prove that DISCOVER finds without redundancy all relevant candidate networks, whose size can be data bound, by exploiting the structure of the schema. We prove that the selection of the optimal execution plan (way to reuse common subexpressions) is NP-complete. We provide a greedy algorithm and we show that it provides near-optimal plan execution time cost. Our experimentation also provides hints on tuning the greedy algorithm."	#*DISCOVER: Keyword Search in Relational Databases. #@Vagelis Hristidis, Yannis Papakonstantinou #t2002 #cVLDB #index53e9b4b4b7602d9703fccc99 #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2fb3b #%53e9a812b7602d9703157cf9 #%53e9a9d3b7602d97033335eb #%53e9aca1b7602d970367f6c9 #%53e9a61fb7602d9702f4dfed #%53e9acf7b7602d97036d82fb #%53e9b31cb7602d9703de949d #%53e9a7c0b7602d97030fc0dc

The net is undergoing a profound change as it moves from an entirely pull-oriented model into a push model. This latter model is far more biological in nature with an increasing amount of information flowing asynchronously through the system to form an InformationBus. The key challenges for the next 20 years will be storing, routing, querying, filtering, managing, and interacting with this bus in a manner that doesn't lead to total systems degradation. Predictive intelligent filtering and rules engines will become more important than querying. Driving factors for this revolution will be the need for push for portable devices due to their poor latency and intermittent communication, an increasing demand for timely information on fully connected devices, a huge rise in application to application integration through asynchronous messaging based on web services and a concomitant requirement for an entirely new type of message broker, and an increasing desire for intelligent agents to cope with information overload as all information becomes available all the time. The key enabling technology will be XML messages and the various technologies that will develop for handling XML ranging from transformation to compression to indexing to storage to programming languages."	#*Data Routing Rather than Databases: The Meaning of the Next Wave of the Web Revolution to Data Management. #@Adam Bosworth #t2002 #cVLDB #index53e9a848b7602d97031940b0 #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2fb3b

Queries over XML data require accurate selectivity estimation of path expressions to optimize query execution plans. Selectivity estimation of XML path expression is usually done based on summary statistics about the structure of the underlying XML repository. All previous methods require an off-line scan of the XML repository to collect the statistics. In this paper, we propose XPathLearner, a method for estimating selectivity of the most commonly used types of path expressions without looking at the XML data. XPathLearner gathers and refines the statistics using query feedback in an on-line manner and is especially suited to queries in Internet scale applications since the underlying XML repository is either inaccessible or too large to be scanned in its entirety. Besides the on-line property, our method also has two other novel features: (a) XPathLearner is workload-aware in collecting the statistics and thus can be more accurate than the more costly off-line method under tight memory constraints, and (b) XPathLearner automatically adjusts the statistics using query feedback when the underlying XML data change. We show empirically the estimation accuracy of our method using several real data sets."	#*XPathLearner: An On-line Self-Tuning Markov Histogram for XML Path Selectivity Estimation. #@Lipyeow Lim, Min Wang, Sriram Padmanabhan, Jeffrey Scott Vitter, Ronald Parr #t2002 #cVLDB #index53e99db1b7602d970266d987 #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2fb3b #%53e9af99b7602d97039e3e7d #%53e999d2b7602d97022180fe #%53e99afdb7602d970238ac7a #%53e9b326b7602d9703df6eca

We introduce a new practical pipelined query operator, termed NRA-RJ, that produces a global rank from input ranked streams based on a score function. The output of NRA-RJ can serve as a valid input to other NRA-RJ operators in the query pipeline. Hence, the NRA-RJ operator can support a hierarchy of join operations and can be easily integrated in query processing engines of commercial database systems. The NRA-RJ operator bridges Fagin's optimal aggregation algorithm into a practical implementation and contains several optimizations that address performance issues. We compare the performance of NRA-RJ against recent rank join algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the performance trade-offs among these algorithms. The experimental results are based on an empirical study applied to a medical video application on top of a prototype database system. The study reveals important design options and shows that the NRA-RJ operator outperforms other pipelined rank join operators when the join condition is an equi-join on key attributes."	#*Joining Ranked Inputs in Practice. #@Ihab F.

Scheduling of workflows is a problem of finding a correct execution sequence for the workflow tasks, i.e., execution that obeys the constraints that embody the business logic of the workflow. Research on workflow scheduling has largely concentrated on temporal constraints, which specify correct ordering of tasks. Another important class of constraints -- those that arise from resource allocation -- has received relatively little attention in workflow modeling. Since typically resources are not limitless and cannot be shared, scheduling of a workflow execution involves decisions as to which resources to use and when.

Can we perform on-line, multi-dimensional analysis and data mining of such data to alert people about dramatic changes of situations and to initiate timely, high-quality responses? This is a challenging task. In this paper, we investigate methods for on-line, multi-dimensional regression analysis of time-series stream data, with the following contributions: (1) our analysis shows that only a small number of compressed regression measures instead of the complete stream of data need to be registered for multi-dimensional linear regression analysis, (2) to facilitate on-line stream data analysis, a partially materialized data cube model, with regression as measure, and a tilt time frame as its time dimension, is proposed to minimize the amount of data to be retained in memory or stored on disks, and (3) an exception-guided drilling approach is developed for on-line, multi-dimensional exception-based regression analysis. Based on this design, algorithms are proposed for efficient analysis of time-series data streams. Our performance study compares the proposed algorithms and identifies the most memory- and time- efficient one for multi-dimensional stream data analysis."	#*Multi-Dimensional Regression Analysis of Time-Series Data Streams. #@Yixin Chen, Guozhu Dong, Jiawei Han, Benjamin W.

Recently, it has been recognized that a \"yes/no\" response to every scenario is just not enough for many modern systems and applications. Many policies require certain conditions to be satisfied and actions to be performed before or after a decision is made. To address this need, this paper introduces the notions of provisions and obligations. Provisions are those conditions that need to be satisfied or actions that must be performed before a decision is rendered, while obligations are those conditions or actions that must be fulfilled by either the users or the system after the decision. This paper formalizes a rule-based policy framework that includes provisions and obligations, and investigates a reasoning mechanism within this framework. A policy decision may be supported by more than one derivation, each associated with a potentially different set of provisions and obligations (called a global PO set). The reasoning mechanism can derive all the global PO sets for each specific policy decision, and facilitates the selection of the best one based on numerical weights assigned to provisions and obligations as well as on semantic relationships among them. The paper also shows the use of the proposed policy framework in a security application."	#*Provisions and Obligations in Policy Management and Security Applications. #@Claudio Bettini, Sushil Jajodia, Xiaoyang Sean Wang, Duminda Wijesekera #t2002 #cVLDB #index53e99c4bb7602d97024fa031 #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2fb3b #%53e9b0bcb7602d9703b30d6f #%53e9ab0db7602d970349050b #%53e9af1fb7602d9703956634 #%53e99800b7602d970200b485 #%53e9a90db7602d970325edac #%53e9b8c1b7602d970449fb38 #%53e99bdcb7602d97024859f0 #%53e9be80b7602d9704b410c7 #%53e99813b7602d970202a777 #%53e99b94b7602d970243ab64

E.g., if we find that average boots sales in the West 10th store of Walmart was the same for winter as for the whole year, it signifies something interesting about the trend of boots sales in that location in that year. In this paper, we are interested in finding succinct summaries of the data cube, exploiting regularities present in the cube, with a clear basis. We would like the summary: (i) to be as concise as possible, (ii) to itself form a lattice preserving the rollup/drilldown semantics of the cube, and (iii) to allow the original cube to be fully recovered. We illustrate the utility of solving this problem and discuss the inherent challenges. We develop techniques for partitioning cube cells for obtaining succinct summaries, and introduce the quotient cube. We give efficient algorithms for computing it from a base table. For monotone aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM on non-negative measures, etc.), our solution is optimal (i.e., quotient cube of the least size). For nonmonotone functions (e.g., AVG), we obtain a locally optimal solution. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of our ideas and techniques and the scalability of our algorithms."	#*Quotient Cube: How to Summarize the Semantics of a Data Cube. #@Laks V. S.

We explore the potential of the suffix tree data structure in this context. We present a new method of building suffix trees, allowing us to build trees in excess of RAM size, which has hitherto not been possible. We show that this method performs in practice as well as the O(n) method of Ukkonen [70]. Using this method we build indexes for 200 Mb of protein and 300 Mbp of DNA, whose disk-image exceeds the available RAM. We show experimentally that suffix trees can be effectively used in approximate string matching with biological data. For a range of query lengths and error bounds the suffix tree reduces the size of the unoptimised O(mn) dynamic programming calculation required in the evaluation of string similarity, and the gain from indexing increases with index size. In the indexes we built this reduction is significant, and less than 0.3&percnt; of the expected matrix is evaluated. We detail the requirements for further database and algorithmic research to support efficient use of large suffix indexes in biological applications."	#*Database indexing for large DNA and protein sequence collections. #@Ela Hunt, Malcolm P.

Recentresearch, however, indicates that cache utilization and performanceis becoming increasingly important on modern platforms. In thispaper, we first demonstrate that in-page data placement is the keyto high cache performance and that NSM exhibits low cacheutilization on modern platforms. Next, we propose a new dataorganization model called PAX (Partition Attributes Across), thatsignificantly improves cache performance by grouping together allvalues of each attribute within each page. Because PAX only affectslayout inside the pages, it incurs no storage penalty and does notaffect I/O behavior. According to our experimental results (whichwere obtained without using any indices on the participatingrelations), when compared to NSM: (a) PAX exhibits superior cacheand memory bandwidth utilization, saving at least 75% of NSM'sstall time due to data cache accesses; (b) range selection queriesand updates on memory-resident relations execute 1725% faster; and(c) TPC-H queries involving I/O execute 1148% faster. Finally, weshow that PAX performs well across different memory system designs."	#*Data page layouts for relational databases on deep memory hierarchies. #@Anastassia Ailamaki, David J.

Energy-conscious design is important at all levels of system architecture, and the software has a key role to play in conserving battery energy on these devices. With the increasing popularity of spatial database applications, and their anticipated deployment on mobile devices (such as road atlases and GPS-based applications), it is critical to examine the energy implications of spatial data storage and access methods for memory resident datasets. While there has been extensive prior research on spatial access methods on resource-rich environments, this is, perhaps, the first study to examine their suitability for resource-constrained environments. Using a detailed cycle-accurate energy estimation framework and four different datasets, this paper examines the pros and cons of three previously proposed spatial indexing alternatives from both the energy and performance angles. Specifically, the Quadtree, Packed R-tree, and Buddy-Tree structures are evaluated and compared with a brute-force approach that does not use an index. The results show that there are both performance and energy trade-offs between the indexing schemes for the different queries. The nature of the query also plays an important role in determining the energy-performance trade-offs. Further, technological trends and architectural enhancements are influencing factors on the relative behavior of the index structures. The work in the query has a bearing on how and where (on a mobile client or/and on a server) it should be performed for performance and energy savings. The results from this study will be beneficial for the design and implementation of embedded spatial databases, accelerating their deployment on numerous mobile devices."	#*Energy-performance trade-offs for spatial access methods on memory-resident data. #@Ning An, Sudhanva Gurumurthi, Anand Sivasubramaniam, Narayanan Vijaykrishnan, Mahmut T.

Indices that efficiently support queries on the spatio-temporal extents of such entities are needed. However, past indexing research has progressed in largely separate spatial and temporal streams. Adding time dimensions to spatial indices, as if time were a spatial dimension, neither supports nor exploits the special properties of time. On the other hand, temporal indices are generally not amenable to extension with spatial dimensions. This paper proposes the first efficient and versatile index for a general class of spatio-temporal data: the discretely changing spatial aspect of an object may be a point or may have an extent; both transaction time and valid time are supported, and a generalized notion of the current time, now, is accommodated for both temporal dimensions. The index is based on the R $^*$-tree and provides means of prioritizing space versus time, which enables it to adapt to spatially and temporally restrictive queries.

Since the number of potential inter-transactional association rules tends to be extremely large, mining inter-transactional associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than mining traditional intra-transactional associations. In order to make such association rule mining truly practical and computationally tractable, in this study we present a template model to help users declare the interesting multidimensional inter-transactional associations to be mined. With the guidance of templates, several optimization techniques, i.e., joining, converging, and speeding, are devised to speed up the discovery of inter-transactional association rules. We show, through a series of experiments on both synthetic and real-life data sets, that these optimization techniques can yield significant performance benefits."	#*A template model for multidimensional inter-transactional association rules. #@Ling Feng, Jeffrey Xu Yu, Hongjun Lu, Jiawei Han #t2002 #cVLDB J. #index53e9a6edb7602d9703026291 #%53e9acb5b7602d9703691d08 #%53e9a1d0b7602d9702acb679 #%53e9a914b7602d9703268be5 #%53e9b891b7602d97044634b7 #%53e99953b7602d9702191f99 #%53e9a5afb7602d9702edb912 #%53e9ab97b7602d9703545bd0 #%53e9b76eb7602d97043110a6 #%53e9be56b7602d9704b171d1 #%53e9abaab7602d97035572f7 #%53e99915b7602d970214fdf2 #%53e99baab7602d970244f70c #%53e99f2eb7602d97027fbff4 #%53e9a6e6b7602d970301b8cb #%53e9bc4eb7602d97048c57b4 #%53e99ab2b7602d970232d54f #%53e99b3cb7602d97023d98ac #%53e9988cb7602d97020c9678 #%53e9be56b7602d9704b171d1 #%53e9a335b7602d9702c41366 #%53e999ffb7602d9702247e35 #%53e9a57db7602d9702ea96d6 #%53e9b102b7602d9703b803ea #%53e99fefb7602d97028cc813 #%53e99a62b7602d97022cf246 #%53e9b7e1b7602d9704391bbd #%53e9ade2b7602d97037ed279 #%53e9be3cb7602d9704afa75f #%53e9b954b7602d970453d01f

The two main applications of the view selection problem are materializing views in a database to speed up query processing, and selecting views to materialize in a data warehouse to answer decision support queries. In addition, view selection is a core problem for intelligent data placement over a wide-area network for data integration applications and data management for ubiquitous computing. We describe several fundamental results concerning the view selection problem. We consider the problem for views and workloads that consist of equality-selection, project and join queries, and show that the complexity of the problem depends crucially on the quality of the estimates that a query optimizer has on the size of the views it is considering to materialize. When a query optimizer has good estimates of the sizes of the views, we show a somewhat surprising result, namely, that an optimal choice of views may involve a number of views that is exponential in the size of the database schema. On the other hand, when an optimizer uses standard estimation heuristics, we show that the number of necessary views and the expression size of each view are polynomially bounded."	#*A Formal Perspective on the View Selection Problem. #@Rada Chirkova, Alon Y.

The basic idea of the A-tree is the introduction of virtual bounding rectangles (VBRs) which contain and approximate MBRs or data objects. VBRs can be represented quite compactly and thus affect the tree configuration both quantitatively and qualitatively. First, since tree nodes can contain a large number of VBR entries, fanout becomes large, which increases search speed. More importantly, we have a free hand in arranging MBRs and VBRs in the tree nodes. Each A-tree node contains an MBR and its children VBRs. Therefore, by fetching an A-tree node, we can obtain information on the exact position of a parent MBR and the approximate position of its children. We have performed experiments using both synthetic and real data sets. For the real data sets, the A-tree outperforms the SR-tree and the VA-file in all dimensionalities up to 64 dimensions, which is the highest dimension in our experiments. Additionally, we propose a cost model for the A-tree. We verify the validity of the cost model for synthetic and real data sets."	#*Spatial indexing of high-dimensional data based on relative approximation. #@Yasushi Sakurai, Masatoshi Yoshikawa, Shunsuke Uemura, Haruhiko Kojima #t2002 #cVLDB J. #index53e99c3db7602d97024ede38 #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e9a58cb7602d9702eb7f70 #%53e9baadb7602d97046dd975 #%53e9ab7eb7602d9703523a2e #%53e9bd2ab7602d97049b7530 #%53e9acc4b7602d97036a4802 #%53e9b655b7602d97041b2707 #%53e9b260b7602d9703d01a49 #%53e9b108b7602d9703b87088 #%53e9b634b7602d970418e6d3 #%53e9b2d2b7602d9703d7fdf2 #%53e9a074b7602d970295e95e #%53e9b3a3b7602d9703e857da #%53e99afeb7602d970238eee8 #%53e9b2b1b7602d9703d59484

In this paper we present a number of techniques for speeding up the construction of quadtree-based spatial indexes, specifically the PMR quadtree, which can index arbitrary spatial data. We assume a quadtree implementation using the “linear quadtree”, a disk-resident representation that stores objects contained in the leaf nodes of the quadtree in a linear index (e.g., a B-tree) ordered based on a space-filling curve. We present two complementary techniques: an improved insertion algorithm and a bulk-loading method. The bulk-loading method can be extended to handle bulk-insertions into an existing PMR quadtree. We make some analytical observations about the I/O cost and CPU cost of our PMR quadtree bulk-loading algorithm, and conduct an extensive empirical study of the techniques presented in the paper. Our techniques are found to yield significant speedup compared to traditional quadtree building methods, even when the size of a main memory buffer is very small compared to the size of the resulting quadtrees."	#*Speeding up construction of PMR quadtree-based spatial indexes. #@Gísli R.

A metric space is formed by a collection of objects and a distance function defined among them which satisfies the triangle inequality. The goal is, given a set of objects and a query, retrieve those objects close enough to the query. The complexity measure is the number of distances computed to achieve this goal. Our data structure, called sa-tree (“spatial approximation tree”), is based on approaching the searched objects spatially, that is, getting closer and closer to them, rather than the classic divide-and-conquer approach of other data structures. We analyze our method and show that the number of distance evaluations to search among n objects is sublinear. We show experimentally that the sa-tree is the best existing technique when the metric space is hard to search or the query has low selectivity. These are the most important unsolved cases in real applications. As a practical advantage, our data structure is one of the few that does not need to tune parameters, which makes it appealing for use by non-experts."	#*Searching in metric spaces by spatial approximation. #@Gonzalo Navarro #t2002 #cVLDB J. #index53e9be72b7602d9704b3495b #%53e9a525b7602d9702e48765 #%53e9b457b7602d9703f539c8 #%53e9ac6ab7602d970363df94 #%53e9b234b7602d9703ccf87c #%53e9b6fab7602d970428fa9c #%53e9b98bb7602d970457e996 #%53e9a335b7602d9702c3f01c #%53e9a8ffb7602d970325074e #%53e998d4b7602d970210cc4c #%53e99b16b7602d97023ad222 #%53e99845b7602d9702073c2e #%53e9b8bab7602d9704494c9b #%53e9b1a9b7602d9703c33e40 #%53e9acfeb7602d97036ddaf2 #%53e99d6cb7602d9702629263 #%53e99e30b7602d97026f22aa #%53e9be72b7602d9704b3495b #%53e9b672b7602d97041d7a7d #%53e9b1bcb7602d9703c497ed

Nearly all data providers are adding XML import or export capabilities, and standard XML Schemas and DTDs are being promoted for all types of data sharing. The ubiquity of XML has removed one of the major obstacles to integrating data from widely disparate sources - namely, the heterogeneity of data formats. However, general-purpose integration of data across the wide are a also requires a query processor that can query data sources on demand, receive streamed XML data from them, and combine and restructure the data into new XML output - while providing good performance for both batch-oriented and ad hoc, interactive queries. This is the goal of the Tukwila data integration system, the first system that focuses on network-bound, dynamic XML data sources. In contrast to previous approaches, which must read, parse, and often store entire XML objects before querying them, Tukwila can return query results even as the data is streaming into the system. Tukwila is built with a new system architecture that extends adaptive query processing and relational-engine techniques into the XML realm, as facilitated by a pair of operators that incrementally evaluate a query's input path expressions as data is read. In this paper, we describe the Tukwila architecture and its novel aspects, and we experimentally demonstrate that Tukwila provides better overall query performance and faster initial answers than existing systems, and has excellent scalability."	#*An XML query engine for network-bound data. #@Zachary G.

Most of these data sources are compliant with some standard for interoperable access. In addition, sources may support a common semantics, i.e., a shared meaning for the data types and their domains. However, sharing data among a global community of users is still difficult because of the following reasons: (i) data providers need a mechanism for describing and publishing available sources of data; (ii) data administrators need a mechanism for discovering the location of published sources and obtaining metadata from these sources; and (iii) users need a mechanism for browsing and selecting sources. This paper describes a system, WebSemantics, that accomplishes the above tasks. We describe an architecture for the publication and discovery of scientific data sources, which is an extension of the World Wide Web architecture and protocols. We support catalogs containing metadata about data sources for some application domain. We define a language for discovering sources and querying their metadata. We then describe the WebSemantics prototype."	#*Locating and accessing data repositories with WebSemantics. #@George A.

In this context, view definitions are very large, involving lots of sources, and there is no apparent limitation to their size. This raises interesting problems that we address in the paper: (i) how to distribute views over several machines without having a negative impact on the query translation process; (ii) how to quickly select the relevant part of a view given a query; (iii) how to minimize the cost of communicating potentially large queries to the machines where they will be evaluated. The solution that we propose is based on a simple view definition language that allows for automatic generation of views. The language maps paths in the view abstract DTD to paths in the concrete source DTDs. It enables a distributed implementation of the view system that is scalable both in terms of data and load.

At present, database systems do not provide adequate array support: arrays can neither be easily defined nor conveniently manipulated. Further, array manipulations are not optimized. This paper describes a language called the Array Manipulation Language (AML), for expressing array manipulations, and a collection of optimization techniques for AML expressions.In the AML framework for array manipulation, arbitrary externally-defined functions can be applied to arrays in a structured manner. AML can be adapted to different application domains by choosing appropriate external function definitions. This paper concentrates on arrays occurring in databases of digital images such as satellite or medical images.AML queries can be treated declaratively and subjected to rewrite optimizations. Rewriting minimizes the number of applications of potentially costly external functions required to compute a query result. AML queries can also be optimized for space. Query results are generated a piece at a time by pipelined execution plans, and the amount of memory required by a plan depends on the order in which pieces are generated. An optimizer can consider generating the pieces of the query result in a variety of orders, and can efficiently choose orders that require less space.

In this paper we first perform an analysis to determine the factors that affect the performance of predictive queries and show that several of these factors are not considered by the TPR-tree, which uses the insertion/deletion algorithms of the R*-tree designed for static data. Motivated by this, we propose a new index structure called the TPR*- tree, which takes into account the unique features of dynamic objects through a set of improved construction algorithms. In addition, we provide cost models that determine the optimal performance achievable by any data-partition spatio-temporal access method. Using experimental comparison, we illustrate that the TPR*-tree is nearly-optimal and significantly outperforms the TPR-tree under all conditions."	#*The TPR*-Tree: An Optimized Spatio-Temporal Access Method for Predictive Queries. #@Yufei Tao, Dimitris Papadias, Jimeng Sun #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9b56cb7602d97040a42d2 #%53e9a98eb7602d97032eaafc #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e9aa41b7602d97033acde0 #%53e9b275b7602d9703d1738f #%53e9ae69b7602d97038835e7 #%53e9b6dbb7602d970426ac13 #%53e9a202b7602d9702b01968

Commercial relational database management systems (RDBMSs) generally provide querying capabilities for text attributes that incorporate state-of-the-art information retrieval (IR) relevance ranking strategies, but this search functionality requires that queries specify the exact column or columns against which a given list of keywords is to be matched. This requirement can be cumbersome and inflexible from a user perspective: good answers to a keyword query might need to be \"assembled\" -in perhaps unforeseen ways- by joining tuples from multiple relations. This observation has motivated recent research on free-form keyword search over RDBMSs. In this paper, we adapt IR-style document-relevance ranking strategies to the problem of processing free-form keyword queries over RDBMSs. Our query model can handle queries with both AND and OR semantics, and exploits the sophisticated single-column text-search functionality often available in commercial RDBMSs. We develop query-processing strategies that build on a crucial characteristic of IR-style keyword search: only the few most relevant matches -according to some definition of \"relevance\"- are generally of interest. Consequently, rather than computing all matches for a keyword query, which leads to inefficient executions, our techniques focus on the top-k matches for the query, for moderate values of k. A thorough experimental evaluation over real data shows the performance advantages of our approach."	#*Efficient IR-Style Keyword Search over Relational Databases. #@Vagelis Hristidis, Luis Gravano, Yannis Papakonstantinou #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9bd87b7602d9704a2f764 #%53e9a9d3b7602d97033335eb #%53e9a965b7602d97032bad69 #%53e9bad0b7602d97046fd79f #%53e9a1c3b7602d9702abdc4a #%53e9a7c0b7602d97030fc0dc #%53e9b4b4b7602d9703fccc99

A fundamental difficulty with building decision support tools based on aggregated traffic data feeds is one of data quality. Data quality problems stem from network-specific issues (irregular polling caused by UDP packet drops and delays, topological mislabelings, etc.) and make it difficult to distinguish between artifacts and actual phenomena, rendering data analysis based on such data feeds ineffective. In principle, traditional integrity constraints and triggers may be used to enforce data quality. In practice, data cleaning is done outside the database and is ad-hoc. Unfortunately, these approaches are too rigid and limited for the subtle data quality problems arising from network data where existing problems morph with network dynamics, new problems emerge over time, and poor quality data in a local region may itself indicate an important phenomenon in the underlying network. We need a new approach - both in principle and in practice - to face data quality problems in network traffic databases. We propose a continuous data quality monitoring approach based on probabilistic, approximate constraints (PACs). These are simple, user-specified rule templates with open parameters for tolerance and likelihood. We use statistical techniques to instantiate suitable parameter values from the data, and show how to apply them for monitoring data quality.In principle, our PAC-based approach can be applied to data quality problems in any data feed. We present PAC-Man, which is the system that manages PACs for the entire aggregate network traffic database in a large ISP, and show that it is very effective in monitoring data quality problems."	#*Checks and Balances: Monitoring Data Quality Problems in Network Traffic Databases. #@Flip Korn, S.

For such applications, we have developed PSoup, a system that combines the processing of ad-hoc and continuous queries by treating data and queries symmetrically, allowing new queries to be applied to old data and new data to be applied to old queries. PSoup also supports intermittent connectivity by separating the computation of query results from the delivery of those results.

This is because the large volumes of data arriving in a stream renders most traditional algorithms too inefficient. In recent years, a few one-pass clustering algorithms have been developed for the data stream problem. Although such methods address the scalability issues of the clustering problem, they are generally blind to the evolution of the data and do not address the following issues: (1) The quality of the clusters is poor when the data evolves considerably over time. (2) A data stream clustering algorithm requires much greater functionality in discovering and exploring clusters over different portions of the stream. The widely used practice of viewing data stream clustering algorithms as a class of one-pass clustering algorithms is not very useful from an application point of view. For example, a simple one-pass clustering algorithm over an entire data stream of a few years is dominated by the outdated history of the stream. The exploration of the stream over different time windows can provide the users with a much deeper understanding of the evolving behavior of the clusters. At the same time, it is not possible to simultaneously perform dynamic clustering over all possible time horizons for a data stream of even moderately large volume. This paper discusses a fundamentally different philosophy for data stream clustering which is guided by application-centered requirements. The idea is divide the clustering process into an online component which periodically stores detailed summary statistics and an offine component which uses only this summary statistics. The offine component is utilized by the analyst who can use a wide variety of inputs (such as time horizon or number of clusters) in order to provide a quick understanding of the broad clusters in the data stream. The problems of efficient choice, storage, and use of this statistical data for a fast data stream turns out to be quite tricky. For this purpose, we use the concepts of a pyramidal time frame in conjunction with a microclustering approach. Our performance experiments over a number of real and synthetic data sets illustrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and insights provided by our approach."	#*A Framework for Clustering Evolving Data Streams. #@Charu C.

Since input stream rates and other system parameters such as the amount of available computing resources can fluctuate significantly, a stream query plan must be able to adapt to these changes. Routing tuples between operators of a distributed stream query plan is used in several data stream management systems as an adaptive query optimization technique. The routing policy used can have a significant impact on system performance. In this paper, we use a queuing network to model a distributed stream query plan and define performance metrics for response time and system throughput.

While this strict separation of concerns has lasted for many years, in this talk I will argue that the gap has recently narrowed to the point where the two fields now have much to say to each other. Networking research has traditionally focused on enabling communication between network hosts. This research program has produced a myriad of specific algorithms and protocols to solve such problems as error recovery, congestion control, routing, multicast and quality-of-service. It has also led to a set of general architectural principles, such as fate sharing and the end-to-end principle, that provide widely applicable guidelines for allocating functionality among network entities."	#*The Data-Centric Revolution in Networking. #@Scott Shenker #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9b19cb7602d9703c2527c

IrisNet is a potentially global network of smart sensing nodes, with webcams or other monitoring devices, and organizing nodes that provide the means to query recent and historical sensor-based data. IrisNet exploits the fact that high-volume sensor feeds are typically attached to devices with significant computing power and storage, and running a standard operating system. It uses aggressive filtering, smart query routing, and semantic caching to dramatically reduce network bandwidth utilization and improve query response times, as we demonstrate. Our demo will present two services built on Iris-Net, from two very different application domains. The first one, a parking space finder, utilizes webcams that monitor parking spaces to answer queries such as the availability of parking spaces near a user's destination.

The focus of this paper is on the maintenance of continuous K- nearest neighbor (k-NN) queries on moving points when updates are allowed. Updates change the functions describing the motion of the points, causing pending events to change. Events are processed to keep the query result consistent as points move. It is shown that the cost of maintaining a continuous k-NN query result for moving points represented in this way can be significantly reduced with a modest increase in the number of events processed in the presence of updates. This is achieved by introducing a continuous within query to filter the number of objects that must be taken into account when maintaining a continuous k-NN query. This new approach is presented and compared with other recent work. Experimental results are presented showing the utility of this approach."	#*Continuous K-Nearest Neighbor Queries for Continuously Moving Points with Updates. #@Glenn S.

We develop algorithms that preprocess relations and construct indices to efficiently provide answers to OPAC queries. The answers returned by our indices are approximate, not exact, and provide guarantees for their accuracy. Moreover, the indices can be tuned easily to meet desired accuracy levels, providing a graceful tradeoff between answer accuracy and index space.

If maintained over long periods, interpretation and usage of their schemas often shifts. Therefore, traditional data scrubbing techniques based on existing schema and integrity constraint documentation are hardly applicable. So-called data auditing environments circumvent this problem by using machine learning techniques in order to induce semantically meaningful structures from the actual data, and then classifying outliers that do not fit the induced schema as potential errors. However, as the quality of the analyzed database is a-priori unknown, the design of data auditing environments requires special methods for the calibration of error measurements based on the induced schema. In this paper, we present a data audit test generator that systematically generates and pollutes artificial benchmark databases for this purpose. The test generator has been implemented as part of a data auditing environment based on the well-known machine learning algorithm C4.5. Validation in the partial quality audit of a large service-related database at Daimler-Chrysler shows the usefulness of the approach as a complement to standard data scrubbing."	#*Systematic Development of Data Mining-Based Data Quality Tools. #@Dominik Lübbers, Udo Grimmer, Matthias Jarke #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9af13b7602d970394e3f3 #%53e9bb44b7602d970478494e #%53e9bb72b7602d97047b70c0 #%53e9b228b7602d9703cc227e #%53e9a480b7602d9702d9e8f7 #%53e99a92b7602d970230a9a8 #%53e9b0c2b7602d9703b38520 #%53e9a29db7602d9702ba4269 #%53e9b8b3b7602d970448ddc2 #%53e9ab89b7602d9703535173 #%53e9a609b7602d9702f35f7e

OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing) systems constitute the kernel of the information systems used today to support the daily operations of most of the business. Although these systems comprise the best examples of complex business-critical systems, no practical way has been proposed so far to characterize the impact of faults in such systems or to compare alternative solutions concerning dependability features. This paper proposes a dependability benchmark for OLTP systems. This dependability benchmark uses the workload of the TPC-C performance benchmark and specifies the measures and all the steps required to evaluate both the performance and key dependability features of OLTP systems, with emphasis on availability. This dependability benchmark is presented through a concrete example of benchmarking the performance and dependability of several different transactional systems configurations. The effort required to run the dependability benchmark is also discussed in detail."	#*A Dependability Benchmark for OLTP Application Environments. #@Marco Vieira, Henrique Madeira #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9aa02b7602d970336e21f #%53e99da4b7602d97026652bc #%53e9a8aab7602d97031f8efb #%53e9bb61b7602d97047a2837 #%53e999e0b7602d9702224257 #%53e9ab9eb7602d970354b0e1 #%53e9ba2db7602d970463b0ec #%53e9bad0b7602d97046fdaad #%53e9bc53b7602d97048cb92c

Then, a clustering algorithm is applied to these representatives only, and a clustering structure for the whole data set is derived, based on the result for the representatives. Most previous methods are, however, limited in their application domain. They are in general based on sufficient statistics such as the linear sum of a set of points, which assumes that the data is from a vector space. On the other hand, in many important applications, the data is from a metric non-vector space, and only distances between objects can be exploited to construct effective data summarizations. In this paper, we develop a new data summarization method based only on distance information that can be applied directly to non-vector data. An extensive performance evaluation shows that our method is very effective in finding the hierarchical clustering structure of non-vector data using only a very small number of data summarizations, thus resulting in a large reduction of runtime while trading only very little clustering quality."	#*Data Bubbles for Non-Vector Data: Speeding-up Hierarchical Clustering in Arbitrary Metric Spaces. #@Jianjun Zhou, Jörg Sander #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9aa2bb7602d9703397ef0 #%53e99a48b7602d97022a7d7b #%53e9b30ab7602d9703dd2d86 #%53e9bc26b7602d970489015d #%53e99c4bb7602d97024f916e

A major factor in the cost of executing a query is given by the lengths of the inverted lists for the query terms, which increase with the size of the document collection and are often in the range of many megabytes. To address this issue, IR and database researchers have proposed pruning techniques that compute or approximate term-based ranking functions without scanning over the full inverted lists. Over the last few years, search engines have incorporated new types of ranking techniques that exploit aspects such as the hyperlink structure of the web or the popularity of a page to obtain improved results. We focus on the question of how such techniques can be efficiently integrated into query processing. In particular, we study pruning techniques for query execution in large engines in the case where we have a global ranking of pages, as provided by Pagerank or any other method, in addition to the standard term-based approach. We describe pruning schemes for this case and evaluate their efficiency on an experimental cluster-based search engine with million web pages.

There has been something of a disconnect between research in this area and the reality of data-base data; much recent research has focused on approximate query processing over ordered or numerical attributes, but arguably the majority of database attributes are categorical: country, state, job_title, color, sex, department, and so on. This paper considers the problem of approximation of aggregate functions over categorical data, or mixed categorical/numerical data. We propose a method based upon random sampling, called Approximate Pre-Aggregation (APA). The biggest drawback of sampling for aggregate function estimating is the sensitivity of sampling to attribute value skew, and APA uses several techniques to overcome this sensitivity. The increase in accuracy using APA compared to \"plain vanilla\" sampling is dramatic. For SUM and AVG queries, the relative error for random sampling alone is more than 700% greater than for sampling with APA. Even if stratified sampling techniques are used, the error is still between 28% and 175% greater than for APA."	#*Robust Estimation With Sampling and Approximate Pre-Aggregation. #@Chris Jermaine #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e99d4bb7602d97026000de #%53e9ad98b7602d9703792b86 #%53e9b2c6b7602d9703d6f1b0 #%53e9aa2cb7602d970339b778 #%53e9ae17b7602d970382881d #%53e9ab38b7602d97034c696d #%53e9ba69b7602d9704687880 #%53e9ae48b7602d970385cf97

Its efficient computation, maintenance, and utilization for query answering and advanced analysis have been the subjects of numerous studies. However, for many applications, the huge size of the data cube limits its applicability as a means for semantic exploration by the user. Recently, we have developed a systematic approach to achieve efficacious data cube construction and exploration by semantic summarization and compression. Our approach is pivoted on a notion of quotient cube that groups together structurally related data cube cells with common (aggregate) measure values into equivalence classes. The equivalence relation used to partition the cube lattice preserves the roll-up/drill-down semantics of the data cube, in that the same kind of explorations can be conducted in the quotient cube as in the original cube, between classes instead of between cells. We have also developed compact data structures for representing a quotient cube and efficient algorithms for answering queries using a quotient cube for its incremental maintenance against updates. We have implemented SOCQET, a prototype data warehousing system making use of our results on quotient cube. In this demo, we will demonstrate (1) the critical techniques of building a quotient cube; (2) use of a quotient cube to answer various queries and to support advanced OLAP; (3) an empirical study on the effectiveness and efficiency of quotient cube-based data warehouses and OLAP; (4) a user interface for visual and interactive OLAP; and (5) SOCQET, a research prototype data warehousing system integrating all the techniques.

Unfortunately, these sequences cannot be processed efficiently by current database systems because they typically optimize and process each statement in isolation. We propose a practical approach for this optimization problem, called \"coarse-grained optimization,\" complementing the conventional query optimization phase. This new approach exploits the fact that statements of a sequence are correlated since they belong to the same information request. A lightweight heuristic optimizer modifies a given statement sequence using a small set of rewrite rules. Since the optimizer is part of a separate system layer, it is independent of but can be tuned to a specific underlying database system.

These primitives also appear to be useful in a variety of practical scenarios besides workload summarization. Today's SQL is inadequate to express these primitives conveniently.

Instances of such data can be viewed as data streams. In this paper, we consider techniques for creating a resilient and efficient content distribution network for such dynamically changing streaming data. We address the problem of maintaining the coherency of dynamic data items in a network of repositories: data disseminated to one repository is filtered by that repository and disseminated to repositories dependent on it. Our method is resilient to link failures and repository failures. This resiliency implies that data fidelity is not lost even when the repository from which (or a communication path through which) a user obtains data experiences failures. Experimental evaluation, using real world traces of streaming data, demonstrates that (i) the (computational and communication) cost of adding this redundancy is low, and (ii) surprisingly, in many cases, adding resiliency enhancing features actually improves the fidelity provided by the system even in cases when there are no failures. To further enhance fidelity, we also propose efficient techniques for filtering data arriving at one repository and for scheduling the dissemination of filtered data to another repository. Our results show that the combination of resiliency enhancing and efficiency improving techniques in fact help derive the potential that push based systems are said to have in delivering 100% fidelity. Without them, computational and communication delays inherent in dissemination networks can lead to a large fidelity loss even in push based dissemination."	#*An Efficient and Resilient Approach to Filtering and Disseminating Streaming Data. #@Shetal Shah, Shyamshankar Dharmarajan, Krithi Ramamritham #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9bc9eb7602d970491e13e #%53e9b732b7602d97042c7dc2 #%53e9a8b8b7602d9703208dc4 #%53e9a232b7602d9702b376d8 #%53e9a1fbb7602d9702afe063 #%53e99905b7602d970214452e #%53e99cb5b7602d9702568b3f #%53e99cb5b7602d97025672a1 #%53e9bcfdb7602d9704986a68 #%53e9b35ab7602d9703e35f98 #%53e99cf5b7602d97025ab209 #%53e99dbeb7602d970267b46e #%53e9acefb7602d97036cbbda #%53e9b2b2b7602d9703d5df13 #%53e9a350b7602d9702c59fce #%53e9a973b7602d97032c8e34 #%53e9b430b7602d9703f2ac9c

This text applies (and adapts) this successful principle to database-supported XML and XPath processing: the relational system is made tree aware, i.e., tree properties like subtree size, intersection of paths, inclusion or disjointness of subtrees are made explicit. We propose a local change to the database kernel, the staircase join, which encapsulates the necessary tree knowledge needed to improve XPath performance. Staircase join operates on an XML encoding which makes this knowledge available at the cost of simple integer operations (e.g., +, ≤ ). We finally report on quite promising experiments with a staircase join enhanced main-memory database kernel."	#*Staircase Join: Teach a Relational DBMS to Watch its (Axis) Steps. #@Torsten Grust, Maurice van Keulen, Jens Teubner #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9a13fb7602d9702a33280 #%53e9a0fbb7602d97029e6ee7 #%53e99a56b7602d97022bc9b1 #%53e9be6cb7602d9704b2d193 #%53e9a6a6b7602d9702fda536 #%53e9a58bb7602d9702eb23b4 #%53e99f0ab7602d97027da91e

However, when the semantics of a document are considered redundancy may be reduced, node identifiers removed where value-based keys are available, and semantic constraints validated using relational primary key technology. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint definition called XFDs that capture structural as well as semantic information. We present a set of rewriting rules for XFDs, and use them to design a polynomial time algorithm which, given an input set of XFDs, computes a reduced set of XFDs. Based on this algorithm, we present a redundancy removing storage mapping from XML to relations called RRXS.

Research to improve query response time has been largely concentrated on indexing paths, and optimizing XML queries. An orthogonal approach is to discover frequent XML query patterns and cache their results to improve the performance of XML management systems. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm called FastXMiner, to discover frequent XML query patterns. We develop theorems to prove that only a small subset of the generated candidate patterns needs to undergo expensive tree containment tests. In addition, we demonstrate how the frequent query patterns can be used to improve caching performance. Experiments results show that FastXMiner is efficient and scalable, and caching the results of frequent patterns significantly improves the query response time."	#*Efficient Mining of XML Query Patterns for Caching. #@Liang Huai Yang, Mong-Li Lee, Wynne Hsu #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9b607b7602d970415f830 #%53e9ae48b7602d970385e7be #%53e9b5f3b7602d9704143827 #%53e9a9e6b7602d970334c38d #%53e9b844b7602d9704402b3d #%53e99a56b7602d97022bc9b1 #%53e9bc6db7602d97048e6f1b #%53e9a813b7602d970315a659 #%53e9b91eb7602d970450435a #%53e99803b7602d97020146b7 #%53e9a58bb7602d9702eb23b4 #%53e9b102b7602d9703b803ea #%53e9b4f5b7602d9704024f4c #%53e9b4f4b7602d970401e405 #%53e9b137b7602d9703bb6b97 #%53e9a650b7602d9702f80fb2 #%53e9a6f5b7602d970302c168

Second, we show that compressed structures can be queried directly and efficiently through a process of manipulating selections of nodes and partial decompression. We study both the theoretical and experimental properties of this technique and provide algorithms for querying our compressed instances using node-selecting path query languages such as XPath.

Typically, these queries involve joins, where users are usually interested only in the top-k join results. Current relational query processors do not handle ranking queries efficiently, especially when joins are involved. In this paper, we address supporting top-k join queries in relational query processors. We introduce a new rank-join algorithm that makes use of the individual orders of its inputs to produce join results ordered on a user-specified scoring function. The idea is to rank the join results progressively during the join operation. We introduce two physical query operators based on variants of ripple join that implement the rank-join algorithm. The operators are nonblocking and can be integrated into pipelined execution plans. We address several practical issues and optimization heuristics to integrate the new join operators in practical query processors. We implement the new operators inside a prototype database engine based on PREDATOR. The experimental evaluation of our approach compares recent algorithms for joining ranked inputs and shows superior performance."	#*Supporting Top-k Join Queries in Relational Databases. #@Ihab F.

In this paper, we present several novel techniques to effectively construct cell density based spatial histograms for range (window) summarizations restricted to the four most important topological relations: contains, contained, overlap, and disjoint. We first present a novel framework to construct a multiscale histogram composed of multiple Euler histograms with the guarantee of the exact summarization results for aligned windows in constant time. Then we present an approximate algorithm, with the approximate ratio 19/12, to minimize the storage spaces of such multiscale Euler histograms, although the problem is generally NP-hard. To conform to a limited storage space where only k Euler histograms are allowed, an effective algorithm is presented to construct multiscale histograms to achieve high accuracy. Finally, we present a new approximate algorithm to query an Euler histogram that cannot guarantee the exact answers; it runs in constant time. Our extensive experiments against both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrated that the approximate multiscale histogram techniques may improve the accuracy of the existing techniques by several orders of magnitude while retaining the cost efficiency, and the exact multiscale histogram technique requires only a storage space linearly proportional to the number of cells for the real datasets."	#*Multiscale Histograms: Summarizing Topological Relations in Large Spatial Datasets. #@Xuemin Lin, Qing Liu, Yidong Yuan, Xiaofang Zhou #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9be22b7602d9704ade1b8 #%53e9ba45b7602d97046540b2 #%53e99d9eb7602d970265af22 #%53e9a246b7602d9702b4b534 #%53e9ae84b7602d97038a4c11 #%53e99adcb7602d9702360a28 #%53e9a40eb7602d9702d2a135 #%53e9baf1b7602d9704721f51 #%53e9a85cb7602d97031a40fd #%53e9aa24b7602d9703393716

In turn, the cache utilization of database systems is highly dependent on the physical organization of the records in main-memory. A recently proposed storage model, called PAX, was shown to greatly improve the performance of sequential file-scan operations when compared to the commonly implemented N-ary storage model. However, the PAX storage model can also demonstrate poor cache utilization for other common operations, such as index scans. Under a workload of heterogenous database operations, neither the PAX storage model nor the N-ary storage model is optimal. In this paper, we propose a flexible data storage technique called Data Morphing. Using Data Morphing, a cache-efficient attribute layout, called a partition, is first determined through an analysis of the query workload. This partition is then used as a template for storing data in a cache-efficient way. We present two algorithms for computing partitions, and also present a versatile storage model that accommodates the dynamic reorganization of the attributes in a file. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that the Data Morphing technique provides a significant performance improvement over both the traditional N-ary storage model and the PAX model."	#*Data Morphing: An Adaptive, Cache-Conscious Storage Technique. #@Richard A.

Existing indexing methods developed for multidimensional (ordered) Continuous Data Spaces (CDS) such as R-tree cannot be directly applied to an NDDS. This is because some essential geometric concepts/properties such as the minimum bounding region and the area of a region in a CDS are no longer valid in an NDDS. On the other hand, indexing methods based on metric spaces such as M-tree are too general to effectively utilize the data distribution characteristics in an NDDS. Therefore, their retrieval performance is not optimized. To support efficient similarity searches in an NDDS, we propose a new dynamic indexing technique, called the ND-tree. The key idea is to extend the relevant geometric concepts as well as some indexing strategies used in CDSs to NDDSs. Efficient algorithms for ND-tree construction are presented. Our experimental results on synthetic and genomic sequence data demonstrate that the performance of the ND-tree is significantly better than that of the linear scan and M-tree in high dimensional NDDSs."	#*The ND-Tree: A Dynamic Indexing Technique for Multidimensional Non-ordered Discrete Data Spaces. #@Gang Qian, Qiang Zhu, Qiang Xue, Sakti Pramanik #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9b4c4b7602d9703fe19f2 #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e9b30ab7602d9703dd2d86 #%53e999d8b7602d970221d0f4 #%53e99827b7602d970204b1ad #%53e9aabdb7602d970343d54f #%53e9af7bb7602d97039c2b9f #%53e9b655b7602d97041b2707 #%53e9b0f4b7602d9703b6ec9e #%53e9b1a9b7602d9703c33e40 #%53e9b260b7602d9703d01a49 #%53e9acfeb7602d97036ddaf2 #%53e9a074b7602d970295e95e #%53e9a9b0b7602d970330b0ef #%53e9bd76b7602d9704a17310

Our query processing techniques require only two linear passes over the XML data on disk, and their main memory requirements are in principle independent of the size of the data. The overall running time is O(m + n), where monly depends on the query and n is the size of the data. The query language supported is very expressive and captures exactly all node-selecting queries answerable with only a bounded amount of memory (thus, all queries that can be answered by any form of finite-state system on XML trees). Visiting each tree node only twice is optimal, and current automata-based approaches to answering path queries on XML streams, which work using one linear scan of the stream, are considerably less expressive. These technical results - which give rise to expressive query engines that deal more efficiently with large amounts of data in secondary storage - are complemented with an experimental evaluation of our work."	#*Efficient Processing of Expressive Node-Selecting Queries on XML Data in Secondary Storage: A Tree Automata-based Approach. #@Christoph Koch #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9b4eeb7602d97040169ec #%53e9acbcb7602d9703697916 #%53e99a7fb7602d97022f476e #%53e99a4eb7602d97022b1179 #%53e99d74b7602d970262ce3a #%53e9bd9fb7602d9704a4cace #%53e9ad3bb7602d970371d6d9 #%53e9ab65b7602d97035023ec #%53e9a351b7602d9702c5e241 #%53e99ed2b7602d970279f0de #%53e9bb01b7602d97047376a9

In this paper, we first present a novel data preprocessing technique called shrinking which optimizes the inner structure of data inspired by the Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation[22] in the real world. This data reorganization concept can be applied in many fields such as pattern recognition, data clustering and signal processing. Then, as an important application of the data shrinking preprocessing, we propose a shrinking-based approach for multi-dimensional data analysis which consists of three steps: data shrinking, cluster detection, and cluster evaluation and selection. The process of data shrinking moves data points along the direction of the density gradient, thus generating condensed, widely-separated clusters. Following data shrinking, clusters are detected by finding the connected components of dense cells. The data-shrinking and cluster-detection steps are conducted on a sequence of grids with different cell sizes. The clusters detected at these scales are compared by a cluster-wise evaluation measurement, and the best clusters are selected as the final result. The experimental results show that this approach can effectively and efficiently detect clusters in both low- and high-dimensional spaces."	#*A Shrinking-Based Approach for Multi-Dimensional Data Analysis. #@Yong Shi, Yuqing Song, Aidong Zhang #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9af07b7602d970393f7f4 #%53e997f4b7602d9701ff7484 #%53e99a04b7602d970224f45a #%53e9b7b4b7602d970435e968 #%53e9abb2b7602d9703562be9 #%53e9b655b7602d97041b27b8 #%53e9b51bb7602d970404e08b #%53e9ac22b7602d97035e6dfa

Data grids are being built across the world as the next generation data handling systems for sharing access to data and storage systems within multiple administrative domains. A data grid provides logical name spaces for digital entities and storage resources to create global identifiers that are location independent. Data grid systems provide services on the logical name space for the manipulation, management, and organization of digital entities. Databases are increasingly being used within Grid applications for data and metadata management, and several groups are now developing services for the access and integration of structured data on the Grid. The service-based approach to making data available on the Grid is being encouraged by the adoption of the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA), which is bringing about the integration of the Grid with Web Service technologies. The tutorial will introduce the Grid, and examine the requirements, issues and possible solutions for integrating data into the Grid.

(ii) The queries employ application-specific ranking and ordering relationships over pages and links to filter out and retrieve only the \"best\" query results. In this paper, we model a Web repository in terms of \"Web relations\" and describe an algebra for expressing complex Web queries. Our algebra extends traditional relational operators as well as graph navigation operators to uniformly handle plain, ranked, and ordered Web relations.

In these applications, enormous amounts of state samples are obtained via sensors and are streamed to a database. Further, updates are very frequent and may exhibit locality. While the R-tree is the index of choice for multi-dimensional data with low dimensionality, and is thus relevant to these applications, R-tree updates are also relatively inefficient. We present a bottom-up update strategy for R-trees that generalizes existing update techniques and aims to improve update performance. It has different levels of reorganization--ranging from global to local--during updates, avoiding expensive top-down updates. A compact main-memory summary structure that allows direct access to the R-tree index nodes is used together with efficient bottom-up algorithms. Empirical studies indicate that the bottom-up strategy outperforms the traditional top-down technique, leads to indices with better query performance, achieves higher throughput, and is scalable."	#*Supporting Frequent Updates in R-Trees: A Bottom-Up Approach. #@Mong-Li Lee, Wynne Hsu, Christian S.

The Capture program captures changes made to source data from recovery log files into staging tables, while the Apply program applies the changes from the staging tables to target data. Currently the Capture program only supports capturing changes made by local transactions in a single database log file. With the increasing deployment of partitioned database systems in OLTP environments there is a need to replicate the operational data from the partitioned systems. This paper introduces a system called CaptureEEE which extends the Capture program to capture global transactions executed on partitioned databases supported by DB2 Enterprise-Extended Edition. The architecture and the components of CaptureEEE are presented. The algorithm for merging log entries from multiple recovery log files is discussed in detail."	#*Capturing Global Transactions from Multiple Recovery Log Files in a Partitioned Database System. #@Chengfei Liu, Bruce G.

In this paper, we address the problem of efficient processing of holistic twig joins on all/partly indexed XML documents. In particular, we propose an algorithm that utilizes available indices on element sets. While it can be shown analytically that the proposed algorithm is as efficient as the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of worst case I/O and CPU cost, experimental results on various datasets indicate that the proposed index-based algorithm performs significantly better than the existing ones, especially when binary structural joins in the twig pattern have varying join selectivities."	#*Holistic Twig Joins on Indexed XML Documents. #@Haifeng Jiang, Wei Wang 0011, Hongjun Lu, Jeffrey Xu Yu #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9a813b7602d97031594e3 #%53e99a56b7602d97022bc9b1 #%53e9a813b7602d970315a659 #%53e9a3c7b7602d9702cd90f5 #%53e9bac9b7602d97046f992c #%53e99afdb7602d970238ac7a #%53e9b137b7602d9703bbcc97 #%53e9aa7ab7602d97033f23e2 #%53e9a58bb7602d9702eb23b4 #%53e9b677b7602d97041e0615 #%53e9be80b7602d9704b43a6c

These applications suffer from the limitations of current main-memory XQuery processors which break for rather small documents. In this paper we propose techniques, based on a notion of projection for XML, which can be used to drastically reduce memory requirements in XQuery processors. The main contribution of the paper is a static analysis technique that can identify at compile time which parts of the input document are needed to answer an arbitrary XQuery. We present a loading algorithm that takes the resulting information to build a projected document, which is smaller than the original document, and on which the query yields the same result. We implemented projection in the Galax XQuery processor. Our experiments show that projection reduces memory requirements by a factor of 20 on average, and is effective for a wide variety of queries. In addition, projection results in some speedup during query evaluation."	#*Projecting XML Documents. #@Amélie Marian, Jérôme Siméon #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e99832b7602d9702056c3d #%53e9ad26b7602d97037064b7 #%53e9b2dbb7602d9703d8cf18 #%53e9a813b7602d970315a659 #%53e9a351b7602d9702c5e241 #%53e9b49bb7602d9703fa5ee9 #%53e9afdab7602d9703a2d3f7 #%53e9bb5ab7602d970479c2e6 #%53e9aa56b7602d97033c3fda #%53e99f0ab7602d97027da91e

Cache-conscious indexes focus on better utilization of each cache line for improving search performance of a single lookup. None has exploited cache spatial and temporal locality between consecutive lookups. We show that conventional indexes, even \"cache-conscious\" ones, suffer from significant cache thrashing between accesses. Such thrashing can impact the performance of applications such as stream processing and query operations such as index-nested-loops join. We propose techniques to buffer accesses to memory-resident tree-structured indexes to avoid cache thrashing. We study several alternative designs of the buffering technique, including whether to use fixed-size or variable-sized buffers, whether to buffer at each tree level or only at some of the levels, how to support bulk access while there are concurrent updates happening to the index, and how to preserve the order of the incoming lookups in the output results. Our methods improve cache performance for both cache-conscious and conventional index structures. Our experiments show that buffering techniques enable a probe throughput that is two to three times higher than traditional methods."	#*Buffering Accesses to Memory-Resident Index Structures. #@Jingren Zhou, Kenneth A.

For a given top-N query, the problem is to find the N tuples that satisfy the query the best but not necessarily completely in an efficient manner. Top-N queries are gaining popularity in relational databases and are expected to be very useful for e-commerce applications. Many companies provide the same type of goods and services to the public on the Web, and relational databases may be employed to manage the data. It is not feasible for a user to query a large number of databases. It is therefore desirable to provide a facility where a user query is accepted at some site, suitable tuples from appropriate sites are retrieved and the results are merged and then presented to the user. In this paper, we present a method for constructing the desired facility. Our method consists of two steps. The first step determines which databases are likely to contain the desired tuples for a given query so that the databases can be ranked based on their desirability with respect to the query. Four different techniques are introduced for this step with one requiring no cooperation from local systems. The second step determines how the ranked databases should be searched and what tuples from the searched databases should be returned. A new algorithm is proposed for this purpose. Experimental results are presented to compare different methods and very promising results are obtained using the method that requires no cooperation from local databases."	#*Distributed Top-N Query Processing with Possibly Uncooperative Local Systems. #@Clement T.

Personal folders on chip, networks of sensors and data hosted by autonomous mobile computers are different illustrations of the need for evaluating queries confined in hardware constrained computing devices. RAM is the most limiting factor in this context. This paper gives a thorough analysis of the RAM consumption problem and makes the following contributions. First, it proposes a query execution model that reaches a lower bound in terms of RAM consumption. Second, it devises a new form of optimization, called iteration filter, that drastically reduces the prohibitive cost incurred by the preceding model, without hurting the RAM lower bound. Third, it analyses how the preceding techniques can benefit from an incremental growth of RAM. This work paves the way for setting up co-design rules helping to calibrate the RAM resource of a hardware platform according to given application's requirements as well as to adapt an application to an existing hardware platform. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to devise co-design rules for data centric embedded applications. We illustrate the effectiveness of our techniques through a performance evaluation."	#*Memory Requirements for Query Execution in Highly Constrained Devices. #@Nicolas Anciaux, Luc Bouganim, Philippe Pucheral #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9adaab7602d97037a8db4

These methods store the fact table of a data warehouse clustered according to the dimension hierarchies using special attributes called hierarchical surrogate keys. In the presence of these access methods new processing and optimization techniques have been recently proposed. One important such optimization technique, called Hierarchical Pre-Grouping, uses the hierarchical surrogate keys in order to aggregate the fact table tuples as early as possible and to avoid redundant joins. In this paper, we study the Pre-Grouping transformation, attempting to generalize its applicability and identify its relationship to other similar transformations. Our results include a general algebraic definition of the Pre-Grouping transformation along with the formal definition of sufficient conditions for applying the transformation. Using a provided theorem we show that Pre-Grouping can be applied in the presence of functional and inclusion dependencies without the explicit usage of hierarchical surrogate keys. An additional result of our study is the definition of the Surrogate-Join transformation that can modify a join condition using a number of dependencies. To our knowledge, Surrogate-Join does not belong to any of the Semantic Query Transformation types discussed in the past."	#*The Generalized Pre-Grouping Transformation: Aggregate-Query Optimization in the Presence of Dependencies. #@Aris Tsois, Timos K.

The current set of popular search tools, such as BLAST, employ heuristics to improve the speed of such searches. However, such heuristics can sometimes miss targets, which in many cases is undesirable. The alternative to BLAST is to use an accurate algorithm, such as the Smith-Waterman (S-W) algorithm. However, these accurate algorithms are computationally very expensive, which limits their use in practice. This paper takes on the challenge of designing an accurate and efficient algorithm for evaluating local-alignment searches. To meet this goal, we propose a novel search algorithm, called OASIS. This algorithm employs a dynamic programming A*-search driven by a suffix-tree index that is built on the input data set. We experimentally evaluate OASIS and demonstrate that for an important class of searches, in which the query sequence lengths are small, OASIS is more than an order of magnitude faster than S-W. In addition, the speed of OASIS is comparable to BLAST. Furthermore, OASIS returns results in decreasing order of the matching score, making it possible to use OASIS in an online setting. Consequently, we believe that it may now be practically feasible to query large biological sequence data sets using an accurate local-alignment search algorithm."	#*OASIS: An Online and Accurate Technique for Local-alignment Searches on Biological Sequences. #@Colin Meek, Jignesh M.

One of the key challenges is executing queries on all relevant information sources in a scalable fashion and retrieving fresh results. The key to scalability is to send queries only to the relevant servers and avoid wasting resources on data sources which will not provide any results. Thus, a catalog service, which would determine the relevant data sources given a query, is an essential component in efficiently processing queries in a distributed environment. This paper proposes a catalog framework which is distributed across the data sources themselves and does not require any central infrastructure. As new data sources become available, they automatically become part of the catalog service infrastructure, which allows scalability to large numbers of nodes. Furthermore, we propose techniques for workload adaptability. Using simulation and real-world data we show that our approach is valid and can scale to thousands of data sources."	#*Locating Data Sources in Large Distributed Systems. #@Leonidas Galanis, Yuan Wang, Shawn R.

In a stock-quotes database, for instance, retrieving all quotes concerning a given stock for a given day does not depend on order, because the collection of quotes does not depend on order. By contrast, finding a stock's five-price moving-average in a trades table gives a result that depends on the order of the table. Query languages based on the relational data model can handle order-dependent queries only through add-ons. SQL:1999, for instance, has a new \"window\" mechanism which can sort data in limited parts of a query. Add-ons make order-dependent queries di_cult to write and to optimize. In this paper we show that order can be a natural property of the underlying data model and algebra. We introduce a new query language and algebra, called AQuery, that supports order from-the-ground-up. New order-related query transformations arise in this setting. We show by experiment that this framework - language plus optimization techniques - brings orders-of-magnitude improvement over SQL:1999 systems on many natural order-dependent queries."	#*AQuery: Query Language for Ordered Data, Optimization Techniques, and Experiments. #@Alberto Lerner, Dennis Shasha #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e997e4b7602d9701fdbae1 #%53e99a43b7602d97022a5ace #%53e99b6ab7602d970240f7ca #%53e9aaa9b7602d97034211e0 #%53e9a7d6b7602d9703116d39 #%53e9b46fb7602d9703f6fc8e #%53e9b557b7602d970408e7fe #%53e99d9db7602d9702657890 #%53e9ad04b7602d97036e13e5

But in today's global village, databases should ideally support multilingual text data equally efficiently. While current database systems do support management of multilingual data, we are not aware of any prior studies that compare and quantify their performance in this regard. In this paper, we first compare the multilingual functionality provided by a suite of popular database systems. We find that while the systems support most SQL-defined multilingual functionality, some needed features are not yet implemented. We then profile their performance in handling text data in IS0:8859, the standard database character set, and in Unicode, the multilingual character set. Our experimental results indicate significant performance degradation while handling multilingual data in these database systems. Worse, we find that the query optimizer's accuracy is different between standard and multilingual data types. As a first step towards alleviating the above problems, we propose Cuniform, a compressed format that is trivially convertible to Unicode. Our initial experimental results with Cuniform indicate that it largely eliminates the performance degradation for multilingual scripts with small repertoires.

Providing a unified access to multiple E-commerce search engines selling similar products is of great importance in allowing users to search and compare products from multiple sites with ease. One key task for providing such a capability is to integrate the Web interfaces of these E-commerce search engines so that user queries can be submitted against the integrated interface. Currently, integrating such search interfaces is carried out either manually or semi-automatically, which is inefficient and difficult to maintain. In this paper, we present WISE-Integrator - a tool that performs automatic integration of Web Interfaces of Search Engines. WISE-Integrator employs sophisticated techniques to identify matching attributes from different search interfaces for integration. It also resolves domain differences of matching attributes. Our experimental results based on 20 and 50 interfaces in two different domains indicate that WISE-Integrator can achieve high attribute matching accuracy and can produce high-quality integrated search interfaces without human interactions."	#*WISE-Integrator: An Automatic Integrator of Web Search Interfaces for E-Commerce. #@Hai He, Weiyi Meng, Clement T.

Their abstracted view of storage components hides useful device-specific characteristics, such as disk track boundaries and advanced built-in firmware algorithms. This paper presents a new storage manager architecture, called Lachesis, that exploits and adapts to observable device-specific characteristics in order to achieve and sustain high performance. For DSS queries, Lachesis achieves I/O efficiency nearly equivalent to sequential streaming even in the presence of competing random I/O traffic. In addition, Lachesis simplifies manual configuration and restores the optimizer's assumptions about the relative costs of different access patterns expressed in query plans. Experiments using IBM DB2 I/O traces as well as a prototype implementation show that Lachesis improves standalone DSS performance by 10% on average. More importantly, when running concurrently with an on-line transaction processing (OLTP) workload, Lachesis improves DSS performance by up to 3×, while OLTP also exhibits a 7% speedup."	#*Lachesis: Robust Database Storage Management Based on Device-specific Performance Characteristics. #@Jiri Schindler, Anastassia Ailamaki, Gregory R.

Previous studies have developed two major approaches, top-down vs. bottom-up. The former, represented by the Multi-Way Array Cube (called MultiWay) algorithm [25], aggregates simultaneously on multiple dimensions; however, it cannot take advantage of Apriori pruning [2] when computing iceberg cubes (cubes that contain only aggregate cells whose measure value satisfies a threshold, called iceberg condition). The latter, represented by two algorithms: BUC [6] and H-Cubing[11], computes the iceberg cube bottom-up and facilitates Apriori pruning. BUC explores fast sorting and partitioning techniques; whereas H-Cubing explores a data structure, H-Tree, for shared computation. However, none of them fully explores multi-dimensional simultaneous aggregation. In this paper, we present a new method, Star-Cubing, that integrates the strengths of the previous three algorithms and performs aggregations on multiple dimensions simultaneously. It utilizes a star-tree structure, extends the simultaneous aggregation methods, and enables the pruning of the group-by's that do not satisfy the iceberg condition. Our performance study shows that Star-Cubing is highly efficient and outperforms all the previous methods in almost all kinds of data distributions."	#*Star-Cubing: Computing Iceberg Cubes by Top-Down and Bottom-Up Integration. #@Dong Xin, Jiawei Han, Xiaolei Li, Benjamin W.

By using a compression algorithm specifically designed for relational data, Oracle is able to compress data much more effectively than standard compression techniques. More significantly, unlike other compression techniques, Oracle incurs virtually no performance penalty for SQL queries accessing compressed tables. In fact, Oracle's compression may provide performance gains for queries accessing large amounts of data, as well as for certain data management operations like backup and recovery. Oracle's compression algorithm is particularly well-suited for data warehouses: environments, which contains large volumes of historical data, with heavy query workloads.

This becomes a significant performance bottleneck for Database Management Systems, which rely on secondary storage heavily to store large datasets. Recent advances in nanotechnology have led to the invention of alternative means for persistent storage. In particular, MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) based storage technology has emerged as the leading candidate for next generation storage systems. In order to integrate MEMS-based storage into conventional computing platform, new techniques are needed for I/O scheduling and data placement. In the context of relational data, it has been observed that access to relations needs to be enabled in both row-wise as well as in columnwise fashions. In this paper, we exploit the physical characteristics of MEMS-based storage devices to develop a data placement scheme for relational data that enables retrieval in both row-wise and column-wise manner. We demonstrate that this data layout not only improves I/O utilization, but results in better cache performance."	#*Tabular Placement of Relational Data on MEMS-based Storage Devices. #@Hailing Yu, Divyakant Agrawal, Amr El Abbadi #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9a797b7602d97030cf9a4 #%53e9b740b7602d97042d7db8 #%53e99d4bb7602d97026019d7 #%53e99bf0b7602d970249c679 #%53e99813b7602d970202963c #%53e9b2c6b7602d9703d7208e #%53e9bbe5b7602d97048386de

Multi-Dimensional Clustering is based on the definition of one or more orthogonal clustering attributes (or expressions) of a table. The table is organized physically by associating records with similar values for the dimension attributes in a cluster. Each clustering key is allocated one or more blocks of physical storage with the aim of storing the multiple records belonging to the cluster in almost contiguous fashion. Block oriented indexes are created to access these blocks. In this paper, we describe novel techniques for query processing operations that provide significant performance improvements for MDC tables. Current database systems employ a repertoire of access methods including table scans, index scans, index ANDing, and index ORing. We have extended these access methods for efficiently processing the block based MDC tables. One important concept at the core of processing MDC tables is the block oriented access technique. In addition, since MDC tables can include regular record oriented indexes, we employ novel techniques to combine block and record indexes. Block oriented processing is extended to nested loop joins and star joins as well. We show results from experiments using a star-schema database to validate our claims of performance with minimal overhead."	#*Efficient Query Processing for Multi-Dimensionally Clustered Tables in DB2. #@Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee, Sriram Padmanabhan, Timothy Malkemus, Tony Lai, Leslie Cranston, Matthew Huras #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9a026b7602d970290b149 #%53e9a37ab7602d9702c878a1

When input rates exceed system capacity, the system will become overloaded and latency will deteriorate. Under these conditions, the system will shed load, thus degrading the answer, in order to improve the observed latency of the results. This paper examines a technique for dynamically inserting and removing drop operators into query plans as required by the current load. We examine two types of drops: the first drops a fraction of the tuples in a randomized fashion, and the second drops tuples based on the importance of their content. We address the problems of determining when load shedding is needed, where in the query plan to insert drops, and how much of the load should be shed at that point in the plan. We describe efficient solutions and present experimental evidence that they can bring the system back into the useful operating range with minimal degradation in answer quality."	#*Load Shedding in a Data Stream Manager. #@Nesime Tatbul, Ugur Çetintemel, Stanley B.

In dynamic environments like the Web, data sources may change not only their data but also their schemas, their semantics, and their query capabilities. Such changes must be reflected in the mappings. Mappings left inconsistent by a schema change have to be detected and updated. As large, complicated schemas become more prevalent, and as data is reused in more applications, manually maintaining mappings (even simple mappings like view definitions) is becoming impractical. We present a novel framework and a tool (ToMAS) for automatically adapting mappings as schemas evolve. Our approach considers not only local changes to a schema, but also changes that may affect and transform many components of a schema. We consider a comprehensive class of mappings for relational and XML schemas with choice types and (nested) constraints. Our algorithm detects mappings affected by a structural or constraint change and generates all the rewritings that are consistent with the semantics of the mapped schemas. Our approach explicitly models mapping choices made by a user and maintains these choices, whenever possible, as the schemas and mappings evolve. We describe an implementation of a mapping management and adaptation tool based on these ideas and compare it with a mapping generation tool."	#*Mapping Adaptation under Evolving Schemas. #@Yannis Velegrakis, Renée J.

DSM has excellent I/O behavior when the number of attributes touched in the query is small. It also has a better cache footprint than the n N-ary storage model (NSM) that is used by most database system. However, DSM incurs a high cost in reconstructing the original tuple from the partitions. We first revisit some of the performance problems associated with DSM. We suggest a simple indexing strategy and compare different reconstruction algorithms. The paper then proposes a new mirroring scheme, termed fractured mirrors, using both NSM and DSM models. This scheme combines the best aspects of both models, along with the added benefit of mirroring to better serve an ad-hoc query workload. A prototype system has been built using the Shore storage manager and performance is evaluated using queries from the TPC-H workload."	#*A case for fractured mirrors. #@Ravishankar Ramamurthy, David J.

A core operation in the evaluation of XQuery is the finding of matches for specified tree patterns, and there has been much work towards algorithms for finding such matches efficiently. Multiple XPath expressions can be evaluated by computing one or more tree pattern matches. However, relatively little has been done on efficient evaluation of XQuery queries as a whole. In this paper, we argue that there is much more to XQuery evaluation than a tree pattern match. We propose a structure called generalized tree pattern (GTP) for concise representation of a whole XQuery expression. Evaluating the query reduces to finding matches for its GTP. Using this idea we develop efficient evaluation plans for XQuery expressions, possibly involving join, quantifiers, grouping, aggregation, and nesting. XML data often conforms to a schema. We show that using relevant constraints from the schema, one can optimize queries significantly, and give algorithms for automatically inferring GTP simplifications given a schema. Finally, we show, through a detailed set of experiments using the TIMBER XML database system, that plans via GTPs (with or without schema knowledge) significantly outperform plans based on navigation and straightforward plans obtained directly from the query."	#*From Tree Patterns to Generalized Tree Patterns: On Efficient Evaluation of XQuery. #@Zhimin Chen, H.

The constraints may be \"fuzzy\" in that they hold for most, but not all, of the records, and the columns may be in the same table or different tables. Such constraints are of interest in the context of both data mining and query optimization, and the BHUNT methodology can potentially be adapted to discover fuzzy functional dependencies and other useful relationships. BHUNT first identifies candidate sets of column value pairs that are likely to satisfy an algebraic constraint. This discovery process exploits both system catalog information and data samples, and employs pruning heuristics to control processing costs. For each candidate, BHUNT constructs algebraic constraints by applying statistical histogramming, segmentation, or clustering techniques to samples of column values. Using results from the theory of tolerance intervals, the sample sizes can be chosen to control the number of \"exception\" records that fail to satisfy the discovered constraints. In query-optimization mode, BHUNT can automatically partition the data into normal and exception records. During subsequent query processing, queries can be modified to incorporate the constraints; the optimizer uses the constraints to identify new, more efficient access paths. The results are then combined with the results of executing the original query against the (small) set of exception records. Experiments on a very large database using a prototype implementation of BHUNT show reductions in table accesses of up to two orders of magnitude, leading to speedups in query processing by up to a factor of 6.8."	#*BHUNT: Automatic Discovery of Fuzzy Algebraic Constraints in Relational Data. #@Paul Brown, Peter J.

We study the problem for a rich mapping language, GLAV, that combines the advantages of the known mapping formalisms globalas-view and local-as-view. We first show that even when composing two simple GLAV mappings, the full composition may be an infinite set of GLAV formulas. Second, we show that if we restrict the set of queries to be in CQk (a common restriction in practice), then we can always encode the infinite set of GLAV formulas using a finite representation. Furthermore, we describe an algorithm that given a query and a finite encoding of an infinite set of GLAV formulas, finds all the certain answers to the query. Consequently, we show that for a commonly occuring class of queries it is possible to pre-compose mappings, thereby potentially offering significant savings in query processing."	#*Composing Mappings Among Data Sources. #@Jayant Madhavan, Alon Y.

Let TPQ = TPQ+ ⊂ BPQ+ ⊂ CX Path+ ⊂ X Path+ denote the corresponding subclasses, consisting of queries that do not involve the boolean negation operator not in their predicates. Simulation and bisimulation are two different binary relations on graph vertices that have previously been studied in connection with some of these classes. For instance, TPQ queries can be minimized using simulation. Most relevantly, for an XML document, its bisimulation quotient is the smallest index that covers (i.e., can be used to answer) all BPQ queries. Our results are as follows: • A CXPath+ query can be evaluated on an XML document by computing the simulation of the query tree by the document graph. • For an XML document, its simulation quotient is the smallest covering index for BPQ+. This, together with the previously-known result stated above, leads to the following: For BPQ covering indexes of XML documents, Bisimulation - Simulation = Negation. • For an XML document, its simulation quotient, with the idref edges ignored throughout, is the smallest covering index for TPQ. For any XML document, its simulation quotient is never larger than its bisimulation quotient; in some instances, it is exponentially smaller. Our last two results show that disallowing negation in the queries could substantially reduce the size of the smallest covering index."	#*Covering Indexes for XML Queries: Bisimulation - Simulation = Negation. #@Prakash Ramanan #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e99e6ab7602d9702732379 #%53e99ae7b7602d97023705fd #%53e9b091b7602d9703afb420 #%53e9bae6b7602d97047129f6 #%53e9ab6fb7602d9703510c05 #%53e9aa61b7602d97033d327a #%53e99931b7602d970216cabb #%53e9bb01b7602d97047376a9

It is a powerful language that incorporates both strutural and datatype modeling features. There are many benefits to storing XML Schema compliant data in a database system, including better queryability, optimied updates and stronger validation. However, the fidelity of the XML document cannot be sacrificed. Thus, the fundamental problem facing database implementers is: how can XML Schemes be mapped to relational (and object-relational) database without losing schema semantics or data-fidelity? In this paper, we present the Oracle XML DB solution for a flexible mapping of XML Schemas to object-relational database. It preserves document fidelity, including ordering, namespaces, comments, processing instructions etc., and handles all the XML Schema semantics including cyclic definitions, dervations (extension and restriction), and wildcards. We also discuss various query and update optimiations that involve rewriting XPath operations to directly operate on the underlying relational data."	#*XML Schemas in Oracle XML DB. #@Ravi Murthy, Sandeepan Banerjee #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9bd18b7602d97049a1bc4

While this problem is superficially amenable to well-known techniques such as fine-granularity locking and special lock modes for updates that are associative and commutative, we show that these previous techniques do not fully solve the problem.

Applications relying on SQL have to emulate these calculations using joins, UNION operations, Window Functions and complex CASE expressions. The designated place in SQL for algebraic calculations is the SELECT clause, which is extremely limiting and forces applications to generate queries with nested views, subqueries and complex joins. This distributes Business Modeling computations across many query blocks, making applications coded in SQL hard to develop. The limitations of RDBMS have been filled by spreadsheets and specialized MOLAP engines which are good at formulas for mathematical modeling but lack the formalism of the relational model, are difficult to manage, and exhibit scalability problems. This demo presents a scalable, mathematically rigorous, and performant SQL extensions for Relational Business Modeling, called the SQL Spreadsheet. We present examples of typical Business Modeling computations with SQL spreadsheet and compare them with the ones using standard SQL showing performance advantages and ease of programming for the former. We will show a scalability example where data is processed in parallel and will present a new class of query optimizations applicable to SQL spreadsheet."	#*Business Modelling Using SQL Spreadsheets. #@Andrew Witkowski, Srikanth Bellamkonda, Tolga Bozkaya, Nathan Folkert, Abhinav Gupta, Lei Sheng, Sankar Subramanian #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9aa9cb7602d9703413318 #%53e9b4d9b7602d9703ff948d

Their limited resources (CPU, memory and/or communication bandwidth and power) pose some interesting challenges. We need both powerful and concise \"languages\" to represent the important features of the data, which can (a) adapt and handle arbitrary periodic components, including bursts, and (b) require little memory and a single pass over the data. We propose AWSOM (Arbitrary Window Stream mOdeling Method), which allows sensors in remote or hostile environments to efficiently and effectively discover interesting patterns and trends. This can be done automatically, i.e., with no user intervention and expert tuning before or during data gathering. Our algorithms require limited resources and can thus be incorporated in sensors, possibly alongside a distributed query processing engine [9, 5, 22]. Updates are performed in constant time, using logarithmic space. Existing, state of the art forecasting methods (SARIMA, GARCH, etc) fall short on one or more of these requirements. To the best of our knowledge, AWSOM is the first method that has all the above characteristics. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that AWSOM discovers meaningful patterns over long time periods. Thus, the patterns can also be used to make long-range forecasts, which are notoriously difficult to perform. In fact, AWSOM outperforms manually set up auto-regressive models, both in terms of long-term pattern detection and modeling, as well as by at least 10× in resource consumption."	#*Adaptive, Hands-Off Stream Mining. #@Spiros Papadimitriou, Anthony Brockwell, Christos Faloutsos #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9aafab7602d970347fcab #%53e9b024b7602d9703a82271 #%53e99d4bb7602d97026019d7 #%53e9b4d4b7602d9703ff2565 #%53e9aab0b7602d97034285b3 #%53e9bbd4b7602d9704821919 #%53e9b2c6b7602d9703d6f1b0 #%53e9aa57b7602d97033c7c24 #%53e9bbd4b7602d9704823611 #%53e9aa80b7602d97033f747b #%53e9be3cb7602d9704afa75f #%53e9a130b7602d9702a1f173 #%53e99c29b7602d97024d83cf

We show that the strategy used in systems to date has a previously unreported performance flaw that can negatively impact queries with relatively small windows.

Despite the amount of recent study that has been dedicated to online aggregation on sets (e.g., quantiles, hot items), surprisingly little attention has been paid to summarizing hierarchical structure in stream data. The problem we study in this paper is that of finding Hierarchical Heavy Hitters (HHH): given a hierarchy and a fraction φ, we want to find all HHH nodes that have a total number of descendants in the data stream no smaller than φ of the total number of elements in the data stream, after discounting the descendant nodes that are HHH nodes. The resulting summary gives a topological \"cartogram\" of the hierarchical data. We present deterministic and randomized algorithms for finding HHHs, which builds upon existing techniques by incorporating the hierarchy into the algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate several factors of improvement in accuracy over the straightforward approach, which is due to making algorithms hierarchy-aware."	#*Finding Hierarchical Heavy Hitters in Data Streams. #@Graham Cormode, Flip Korn, S.

In such scenarios, the focus shifts from completing the computation as soon as possible to producing a prefix of the output as soon as possible. To handle this shift in focus, most solutions to date rely upon some combination of streaming binary operators and \"on-the-fly\" execution plan reorganization. In contrast, we consider the alternative of extending existing symmetric binary join operators to handle more than two inputs. Toward this end, we have completed a prototype implementation of a multi-way join operator, which we term the \"MJoin\" operator, and explored its performance. Our results show that in many instances the MJoin produces outputs sooner than any tree of binary operators. Additionally, since MJoins are completely symmetric with respect to their inputs, they can reduce the need for expensive runtime plan reorganization. This suggests that supporting multiway joins in a single, symmetric, streaming operator may be a useful addition to systems that support queries over input streams from remote sites."	#*Maximizing the Output Rate of Multi-Way Join Queries over Streaming Information Sources. #@Stratis Viglas, Jeffrey F.

While providing a general framework of pattern frequency counting, algorithm FTP-DS has two major features, namely one data scan for online statistics collection and regression-based compact pattern representation.To attain the feature of one data scan, the data segmentation and the pattern growth scenarios are explored for the frequency counting purpose. Algorithm FTP-DS scans online transaction flows and generates candidate frequent patterns in real time. The second important feature of algorithm FTP-DS is on the regression-based compact pattern representation. Specifically, to meet the space constraint, we devise for pattern representation a compact ATF (standing for Accumulated Time and Frequency) form to aggregately comprise all the information required for regression analysis. In addition, we develop the techniques of the segmentation tuning and segment relaxation to enhance the functions of FTP-DS. With these features, algorithm FTP-DS is able to not only conduct mining with variable time intervals but also perform trend detection effectively. Synthetic data and a real dataset which contains net-Permission work alarm logs from a major telecommunication company are utilized to verify the feasibility of algorithm FTP-DS."	#*A Regression-Based Temporal Pattern Mining Scheme for Data Streams. #@Wei-Guang Teng, Ming-Syan Chen, Philip S.

There have been many keyword-based search engines built for this purpose. However, these search engines usually suffer from the problem that a relevant Web page may not contain the keyword in its page text. Algorithms exploiting the link structure of Web documents, such as HITS, have also been proposed to overcome the problems of traditional search engines. Though these algorithms perform better than keyword-based search engines, they still have some defects. Among others, one major problem is that links in Web pages are only able to reflect the view of the page authors on the topic of those pages but not that of the page readers. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm with the idea of using virtual links which are created according to what the user behaves in browsing the output list of the query result. These virtual links are then employed to identify authoritative resources in the Web. Speci fically, the algorithm, referred to as algorithm VIPAS (standing for virtual link powered authority search), is divided into three phases. The first phase performs basic link analysis. The second phase collects statistics by observing the user behavior in browsing pages listed in the query result, and virtual links are then created according to what observed. In the third phase, these virtual links as well as real ones are taken together to produce an updated list of authoritative pages that will be presented to the user when the query with similar keywords is encountered next time. A Web warehouse is built and the algorithm is integrated into the system. By conducting experiments on the system, we have shown that VIPAS is not only very effective but also very adaptive in providing much more valuable information to users."	#*VIPAS: Virtual Link Powered Authority Search in the Web. #@Chi-Chun Lin, Ming-Syan Chen #t2003 #cVLDB #index53e9b873b7602d9704443753 #%53e9b70fb7602d97042a799f #%53e9a52bb7602d9702e4c239 #%53e9b437b7602d9703f32991 #%53e9bc5bb7602d97048d6beb #%53e9b131b7602d9703bb4ee8 #%53e9a9d3b7602d97033335eb #%53e9bb1cb7602d97047562b9 #%53e9b2b8b7602d9703d5ff7a #%53e99845b7602d9702073c2e #%53e99915b7602d9702153b39 #%53e9a1d5b7602d9702acf7da #%53e9abf7b7602d97035b7af7 #%53e9a877b7602d97031c327b #%53e9b8c7b7602d97044a91dc #%53e9a2dcb7602d9702be3850

StatMiner uses a hierarchical classification of the queries, and threshold based variants of familiar data mining techniques to dynamically decide the level of resolution at which to learn the statistics. We will demonstrate the major functionalities of StatMiner and the effectiveness of the learned statistics in BibFinder, a publicly available computer science bibliography mediator we developed. The sources that BibFinder integrates are autonomous and can have uncontrolled coverage and overlap.

Expressing queries on time-varying (relational or XML) data is more difficult than writing queries on nontemporal data. In this paper, we present a temporal XML query language, τXQuery, in which we add valid time support to XQuery by minimally extending the syntax and semantics of XQuery. We adopt a stratum approach which maps a τXQuery query to a conventional XQuery. The paper focuses on how to perform this mapping, in particular, on mapping sequenced queries, which are by far the most challenging. The critical issue of supporting sequenced queries (in any query language) is time-slicing the input data while retaining period timestamping. Timestamps are distributed throughout an XML document, rather than uniformly in tuples, complicating the temporal slicing while also providing opportunities for optimization. We propose four optimizations of our initial maximally-fragmented time-slicing approach: selected node slicing, copy-based per-expression slicing, in-place per-expression slicing, and idiomatic slicing, each of which reduces the number of constant periods over which the query is evaluated. While performance tradeoffs clearly depend on the underlying XQuery engine, we argue that there are queries that favor each of the five approaches."	#*Temporal Slicing in the Evaluation of XML Queries. #@Dengfeng Gao, Richard T.

No research has attempted to fully explore the use of attribute values to perform attribute identification. We propose an attribute identification method that employs schema and summary instance information as well as properties of attributes derived from their instances. Unlike other attribute identification methods that match only single attributes, our method matches attribute groups for integration. Because our attribute identification method fully explores data instances, it can identify corresponding attributes to be integrated even when schema information is misleading. Three experiments were performed to validate our attribute identification method. In the first experiment, the heuristic rules derived for attribute classification were evaluated on 119 attributes from nine public domain data sets. The second was a controlled experiment validating the robustness of the proposed attribute identification method by introducing erroneous data. The third experiment evaluated the proposed attribute identification method on five data sets extracted from online music stores. The results demonstrated the viability of the proposed method."	#*Instance-based attribute identification in database integration. #@Cecil Chua Eng Huang, Roger H. L.

Currently Web documents are classified based on their content not taking into account the fact that these documents are connected to each other by links. We claim that a page’s classification is enriched by the detection of its incoming links’ semantics. This would enable effective browsing and enhance the validity of search results in the WWW context. Another aspect that is underaddressed and strictly related to the tasks of browsing and searching is the similarity of documents at the semantic level. The above observations lead us to the adoption of a hierarchy of concepts (ontology) and a thesaurus to exploit links and provide a better characterization of Web documents. The enhancement of document characterization makes operations such as clustering and labeling very interesting. To this end, we devised a system called THESUS. The system deals with an initial sets of Web documents, extracts keywords from all pages’ incoming links, and converts them to semantics by mapping them to a domain’s ontology. Then a clustering algorithm is applied to discover groups of Web documents. The effectiveness of the clustering process is based on the use of a novel similarity measure between documents characterized by sets of terms. Web documents are organized into thematic subsets based on their semantics. The subsets are then labeled, thereby enabling easier management (browsing, searching, querying) of the Web.

It may thus be preferable to vertically partition the class for reducing irrelevant data (instance variables) accessed by the methods. Our prior work has shown that vertical class partitioning can result in a substantial decrease in the total number of disk accesses incurred for executing a set of applications, but coming up with an optimal vertical class partitioning scheme is a hard problem. In this paper, we present two algorithms for deriving optimal and near-optimal vertical class partitioning schemes. The cost-driven algorithm provides the optimal vertical class partitioning schemes by enumerating, exhaustively, all the schemes and calculating the number of disk accesses required to execute a given set of applications. For this, a cost model for executing a set of methods in an OODB system is developed. Since exhaustive enumeration is costly and only works for classes with a small number of instance variables, a hill-climbing heuristic algorithm (HCHA) is developed, which takes the solution provided by the affinity-based algorithm and improves it, thereby further reducing the total number of disk accesses incurred. We show that the HCHA algorithm provides a reasonable near-optimal vertical class partitioning scheme for executing a given set of applications."	#*Cost-driven vertical class partitioning for methods in object oriented databases. #@Chi-Wai Fung, Kamalakar Karlapalem, Qing Li #t2003 #cVLDB J. #index53e9a17fb7602d9702a73271 #%53e9b49bb7602d9703fa7aef #%53e9ace8b7602d97036c3317 #%53e9ab42b7602d97034d5aa0 #%53e9a8f2b7602d9703242a1b #%53e9bd1eb7602d97049a87ed #%53e9a5a8b7602d9702ed5556 #%53e9a464b7602d9702d8183b #%53e9ba39b7602d970464b327 #%53e9b253b7602d9703cf211f #%53e9b500b7602d9704033d2a #%53e9a3f4b7602d9702d08fe0 #%53e9a171b7602d9702a64ea4 #%53e99de1b7602d97026a1a25 #%53e99fbcb7602d9702895530

The latter problem is particularly challenging since a single data update can cause aggregate results to change over the entire time line. We introduce a new index structure called the SB-tree, which incorporates features from both segment-trees and B-trees. SB-trees support fast lookup of aggregate results based on time and can be maintained efficiently when the data change. We extend the basic SB-tree index to handle cumulative (also called moving-window) aggregates, considering separatelycases when the window size is or is not fixed in advance. For materialized aggregate views in a temporal database or warehouse, we propose building and maintaining SB-tree indices instead of the views themselves."	#*Incremental computation and maintenance of temporal aggregates. #@Jun Yang 0001, Jennifer Widom #t2003 #cVLDB J. #index53e9adf0b7602d97037f670e #%53e999ffb7602d970224bf32 #%53e997f4b7602d9701ff7484 #%53e9b091b7602d9703af7d05 #%53e9be72b7602d9704b30a22 #%53e9b601b7602d9704158a95 #%53e9b587b7602d97040c828b #%53e9a11bb7602d9702a0a148 #%53e9a9e6b7602d9703348fc0 #%53e9adf0b7602d97037f670e #%53e9ad72b7602d970375ed6d #%53e9a6a6b7602d9702fda536 #%53e9a297b7602d9702b9cf03 #%53e9a6d0b7602d970300694d #%53e9a098b7602d9702981798

We then present an effective watermarking technique geared for relational data. This technique ensures that some bit positions of some of the attributes of some of the tuples contain specific values. The specific bit locations and values are algorithmically determined under the control of a secret key known only to the owner of the data. This bit pattern constitutes the watermark. Only if one has access to the secret key can the watermark be detected with high probability. Detecting the watermark requires access neither to the original data nor the watermark, and the watermark can be easily and efficiently maintained in the presence of insertions, updates, and deletions. Our analysis shows that the proposed technique is robust against various forms of malicious attacks as well as benign updates to the data. Using an implementation running on DB2, we also show that the algorithms perform well enough to be used in real-world applications."	#*Watermarking relational data: framework, algorithms and analysis. #@Rakesh Agrawal, Peter J.

As a consequence, we cannot retrieve all tuples from these relations. In this article we study the problem of computing the complete answer to a query, i.e., the answer that could be computed if all the tuples could be retrieved. A query is stable if for any instance of the relations in the query, its complete answer can be computed using the access patterns permitted by the relations. We study the problem of testing stability of various classes of queries, including conjunctive queries, unions of conjunctive queries, and conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons. We give algorithms and complexity results for these classes of queries. We show that stability of datalog programs is undecidable, and give a sufficient condition for stability of datalog queries. Finally, we study data-dependent computability of the complete answer to a nonstable query, and propose a decision tree for guiding the process to compute the complete answer."	#*Computing complete answers to queries in the presence of limited access patterns. #@Chen Li #t2003 #cVLDB J. #index53e9a509b7602d9702e2d52c #%53e9a154b7602d9702a46eec #%53e9a18db7602d9702a7f506 #%53e99bf7b7602d97024a280c #%53e9adc2b7602d97037c6761 #%53e9ac19b7602d97035dcefb #%53e9ab1ab7602d97034a1fae #%53e99ef4b7602d97027bdcea #%53e9a440b7602d9702d604f1 #%53e9a026b7602d9702907cb9 #%53e9be51b7602d9704b1205f #%53e9b1ddb7602d9703c712b5 #%53e9ab6fb7602d9703511e8f #%53e9bc7fb7602d97048fca0c #%53e9b137b7602d9703bbbbdd #%53e9aa7ab7602d97033f23e2 #%53e9b326b7602d9703df7c74 #%53e999cab7602d970220f707 #%53e9b9dab7602d97045d3160 #%53e9b38fb7602d9703e73791 #%53e9a751b7602d9703089b26 #%53e9b3ceb7602d9703ebb6ef #%53e9a7c8b7602d9703109317

Manually finding such mappings is tedious, error-prone, and clearly not possible on the Web scale. Hence the development of tools to assist in the ontology mapping process is crucial to the success of the Semantic Web. We describe GLUE, a system that employs machine learning techniques to find such mappings. Given two ontologies, for each concept in one ontology GLUE finds the most similar concept in the other ontology. We give well-founded probabilistic definitions to several practical similarity measures and show that GLUE can work with all of them. Another key feature of GLUE is that it uses multiple learning strategies, each of which exploits well a different type of information either in the data instances or in the taxonomic structure of the ontologies. To further improve matching accuracy, we extend GLUE to incorporate commonsense knowledge and domain constraints into the matching process. Our approach is thus distinguished in that it works with a variety of well-defined similarity notions and that it efficiently incorporates multiple types of knowledge. We describe a set of experiments on several real-world domains and show that GLUE proposes highly accurate semantic mappings.

Applications expected to heavily take advantage of Web service composition include B2B E-commerce and E-government. To date, enabling composite services has largely been an ad hoc, time-consuming, and error-prone process involving repetitive low-level programming. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based framework for the automatic composition of Web services. We present a technique to generate composite services from high-level declarative descriptions. We define formal safeguards for meaningful composition through the use of composability rules. These rules compare the syntactic and semantic features of Web services to determine whether two services are composable. We provide an implementation using an E-government application offering customized services to indigent citizens.

In addition to Web caching, view materialization has been shown to accelerate the generation of dynamic Web content. View materialization is an attractive solution as it decouples the serving of access requests from the handling of updates. In the context of the Web, selecting which views to materialize must be decided online and needs to consider both performance and data freshness, which we refer to as the online view selection problem. In this paper, we define data freshness metrics, provide an adaptive algorithm for the online view selection problem that is based on user-specified data freshness requirements, and present experimental results.

In its most general form, a data stream is actually an update stream, i.e., comprising data-item deletions as well as insertions. Such massive update streams arise naturally in several application domains (e.g., monitoring of large IP network installations or processing of retail-chain transactions). Estimating the cardinality of set expressions defined over several (possibly distributed) update streams is perhaps one of the most fundamental query classes of interest; as an example, such a query may ask “what is the number of distinct IP source addresses seen in passing packets from both router R1 and R 2 but not router R3?”. Earlier work only addressed very restricted forms of this problem, focusing solely on the special case of insert-only streams and specific operators (e.g., union). In this paper, we propose the first space-efficient algorithmic solution for estimating the cardinality of full-fledged set expressions over general update streams. Our estimation algorithms are probabilistic in nature and rely on a novel, hash-based synopsis data structure, termed ”2-level hash sketch”. We demonstrate how our 2-level hash sketch synopses can be used to provide low-error, high-confidence estimates for the cardinality of set expressions (including operators such as set union, intersection, and difference) over continuous update streams, using only space that is significantly sublinear in the sizes of the streaming input (multi-)sets. Furthermore, our estimators never require rescanning or resampling of past stream items, regardless of the number of deletions in the stream. We also present lower bounds for the problem, demonstrating that the space usage of our estimation algorithms is within small factors of the optimal. Finally, we propose an optimized, time-efficient stream synopsis (based on 2-level hash sketches) that provides similar, strong accuracy-space guarantees while requiring only guaranteed logarithmic maintenance time per update, thus making our methods applicable for truly rapid-rate data streams. Our results from an empirical study of our synopsis and estimation techniques verify the effectiveness of our approach."	#*Tracking set-expression cardinalities over continuous update streams. #@Sumit Ganguly, Minos N.

Systems that seek to give rapid or real-time query responses in such an environment must be prepared to deal gracefully with bursts in data arrival without compromising system performance. We discuss one strategy for processing bursty streams - adaptive, load-aware scheduling of query operators to minimize resource consumption during times of peak load. We show that the choice of an operator scheduling strategy can have significant impact on the runtime system memory usage as well as output latency. Our aim is to design a scheduling strategy that minimizes the maximum runtime system memory while maintaining the output latency within prespecified bounds. We first present Chain scheduling, an operator scheduling strategy for data stream systems that is near-optimal in minimizing runtime memory usage for any collection of single-stream queries involving selections, projections, and foreign-key joins with stored relations. Chain scheduling also performs well for queries with sliding-window joins over multiple streams and multiple queries of the above types. However, during bursts in input streams, when there is a buildup of unprocessed tuples, Chain scheduling may lead to high output latency. We study the online problem of minimizing maximum runtime memory, subject to a constraint on maximum latency. We present preliminary observations, negative results, and heuristics for this problem. A thorough experimental evaluation is provided where we demonstrate the potential benefits of Chain scheduling and its different variants, compare it with competing scheduling strategies, and validate our analytical conclusions."	#*Operator scheduling in data stream systems. #@Brian Babcock, Shivnath Babu, Mayur Datar, Rajeev Motwani, Dilys Thomas #t2004 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b02fb7602d9703a8a898 #%53e9a138b7602d9702a2a721 #%53e9a108b7602d97029f384f #%53e9b024b7602d9703a82271 #%53e9b7f5b7602d97043a9a29 #%53e9a620b7602d9702f50815 #%53e9a301b7602d9702c0e0a6 #%53e9ac21b7602d97035e03a8 #%53e9ab4fb7602d97034e2188 #%53e9b607b7602d970415da68 #%53e9a7f1b7602d9703132dca #%53e9aa57b7602d97033c7c24 #%53e9ac4eb7602d970361effd #%53e9ab1ab7602d97034a2a24 #%53e9bb43b7602d970477f997 #%53e9adc7b7602d97037cb4a3 #%53e9a8ccb7602d970321a81d #%53e9b917b7602d9704500623 #%53e99d80b7602d970263ad7d #%53e9acfeb7602d97036df583 #%53e99f2db7602d97027f8653 #%53e9aeb7b7602d97038e0601 #%53e9ac7bb7602d97036509bd #%53e9a9a2b7602d97033030d8 #%53e99b0ab7602d970239bda1 #%53e9b444b7602d9703f420f1 #%53e9a145b7602d9702a367b8 #%53e9a96cb7602d97032c4567

When a mapping is left inconsistent by a schema change, it has to be detected and updated. We present a novel framework and a tool (ToMAS) for automatically adapting (rewriting) mappings as schemas evolve. Our approach considers not only local changes to a schema but also changes that may affect and transform many components of a schema. Our algorithm detects mappings affected by structural or constraint changes and generates all the rewritings that are consistent with the semantics of the changed schemas. Our approach explicitly models mapping choices made by a user and maintains these choices, whenever possible, as the schemas and mappings evolve. When there is more than one candidate rewriting, the algorithm may rank them based on how close they are to the semantics of the existing mappings."	#*Preserving mapping consistency under schema changes. #@Yannis Velegrakis, Renée J.

A fundamental challenge in data stream mining applications (e.g., credit card transaction authorization, security buy-sell transaction, and phone call records, etc) is concept-drift or the discrepancy between the previously learned model and the true model in the new data. The basic problem is the ability to judiciously select data and adapt the old model to accurately match the changed concept of the data stream. StreamMiner uses several techniques to support mining over data streams with possible concept-drifts. We demonstrate the following two key functionalities of StreamMiner: 1. Detecting possible concept-drift on the fly when the trained streaming model is used to classify incoming data streams without knowing the ground truth. 2. Systematic data selection of old data and new data chunks to compute the optimal model that best fits on the changing data streams."	#*StreamMiner: A Classifier Ensemble-based Engine to Mine Concept-drifting Data Streams. #@Wei Fan #t2004 #cVLDB #index53e9b52db7602d970406711c #%53e9b6f3b7602d9704286156 #%53e9b023b7602d9703a7cdff #%53e99946b7602d970218402a #%53e9b607b7602d970415da68 #%53e99fddb7602d97028b9693 #%53e9ac7bb7602d97036524b7 #%53e99809b7602d9702020cce #%53e9a4e4b7602d9702e026eb #%53e9b1b7b7602d9703c483e8 #%53e9a10eb7602d97029fce29 #%53e99c29b7602d97024d83cf #%53e9aecbb7602d97038f4017

However, mining frequent itemsets from transactional data streams has not been well addressed yet in terms of its bounds of memory consumption. The main difficulty is due to the nature of the exponential explosion of itemsets. Given a domain of I unique items, the possible number of itemsets can be up to 2I - 1. When the length of data streams approaches to a very large number N, the possibility of an itemset to be frequent becomes larger and difficult to track with limited memory. However, the real killer of effective frequent itemset mining is that most of existing algorithms are false-positive oriented. That is, they control memory consumption in the counting processes by an error parameter ε, and allow items with support below the specified minimum support s but above s-ε counted as frequent ones. Such false-positive items increase the number of false-positive frequent itemsets exponentially, which may make the problem computationally intractable with bounded memory consumption. In this paper, we developed algorithms that can effectively mine frequent item(set)s from high speed transactional data streams with a bound of memory consumption. While our algorithms are false-negative oriented, that is, certain frequent itemsets may not appear in the results, the number of false-negative itemsets can be controlled by a predefined parameter so that desired recall rate of frequent itemsets can be guaranteed. We developed algorithms based on Chernoff bound. Our extensive experimental studies show that the proposed algorithms have high accuracy, require less memory, and consume less CPU time. They significantly outperform the existing false-positive algorithms."	#*False Positive or False Negative: Mining Frequent Itemsets from High Speed Transactional Data Streams. #@Jeffrey Xu Yu, Zhihong Chong, Hongjun Lu, Aoying Zhou #t2004 #cVLDB #index53e99cafb7602d970255fcd5 #%53e9b6f3b7602d9704286156 #%53e9ad98b7602d9703792b86 #%53e9bba8b7602d97047f490b #%53e9abb1b7602d970355bf0d #%53e9aab0b7602d97034285b3 #%53e9b102b7602d9703b803ea #%53e9a824b7602d9703169bd6 #%53e9b666b7602d97041c91e2 #%53e9b954b7602d970453d01f #%53e9b1c3b7602d9703c55a60

"#*Database architectures for new hardware #@Anastassia Ailamaki #t2004 #cVLDB '04 Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases - Volume 30 #index53909f8c20f70186a0e401fb #!Thirty years ago, DBMS stored data on disks and cached recently used data in main memory buffer pools, while designers worried about improving I/O performance and maximizing main memory utilization. Today, however, databases live in multi-level memory hierarchies that include disks, main memories, and several levels of processor caches. Four (often correlated) factors have shifted the performance bottleneck of data-intensive commercial workloads from I/O to the processor and memory subsystem. First, storage systems are becoming faster and more intelligent (now disks come complete with their own processors and caches). Second, modern database storage managers aggressively improve locality through clustering, hide I/O latencies using prefetching, and parallelize disk accesses using data striping. Third, main memories have become much larger and often hold the application's working set. Finally, the increasing memory/processor speed gap has pronounced the importance of processor caches to database performance. This tutorial will first survey the computer architecture and database literature on understanding and evaluating database application performance on modern hardware. We will present approaches and methodologies used to produce time breakdowns when executing database workloads on modern processors. We will contrast traditional methods that use system simulation to the more realistic, yet challenging use of hardware event counters. Then, we will survey techniques proposed in the literature to alleviate the problem and their evaluation. We will emphasize the importance and explain the challenges when determining the optimal data placement on all levels of memory hierarchy, and contrast to other approaches such as prefetching data and instructions. Finally, we will discuss open problems and future directions: Is it only the memory subsystem database software architects should worry about? How important are other decisions processors make to database workload behavior? Given the emerging multi-threaded, multi-processor computers with modular, deep cache hierarchies, how feasible is it to create database systems that will adapt to their environment and will automatically take full advantage of the underlying hierarchy?"	#*Database Architecture for New Hardware. #@Anastassia Ailamaki #t2004 #cVLDB #index53e9acb5b7602d970368f878 #%53e9b6f3b7602d9704286156

Traditional histogram construction algorithms, such as V-Optimal, optimize absolute error measures for which the error in estimating a true value of 10 by 20 has the same effect of estimating a true value of 1000 by 1010. However, several researchers have recently pointed out the drawbacks of such schemes and proposed wavelet based schemes to minimize relative error measures. None of these schemes provide satisfactory guarantees - and we provide evidence that the difficulty may lie in the choice of wavelets as the representation scheme. In this paper, we consider histogram construction for the known relative error measures. We develop optimal as well as fast approximation algorithms. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in providing significantly more accurate answers through synthetic and real life data sets."	#*REHIST: Relative Error Histogram Construction Algorithms. #@Sudipto Guha, Kyuseok Shim, Jungchul Woo #t2004 #cVLDB #index53e9abe5b7602d97035a2675 #%53e9b6f3b7602d9704286156 #%53e99fbcb7602d9702891fde #%53e99a2bb7602d9702285a62 #%53e9a86fb7602d97031bc0b4 #%53e9b2c6b7602d9703d6f1b0 #%53e9b179b7602d9703c00991 #%53e9ae17b7602d970382881d #%53e99af7b7602d9702384dad #%53e9bc61b7602d97048d83f9 #%53e9a130b7602d9702a1f173 #%53e99832b7602d9702056a67

However, there exist data sets in applications like bioinformatics, statistics, and text processing that are characterized by high dimensionality, e.g., over 100 dimensions, and moderate size, e.g., around 106 tuples. No feasible data cube can be constructed with such data sets. In this paper we will address the problem of developing an efficient algorithm to perform OLAP on such data sets. Experience tells us that although data analysis tasks may involve a high dimensional space, most OLAP operations are performed only on a small number of dimensions at a time. Based on this observation, we propose a novel method that computes a thin layer of the data cube together with associated value-list indices. This layer, while being manageable in size, will be capable of supporting flexible and fast OLAP operations in the original high dimensional space. Through experiments we will show that the method has I/O costs that scale nicely with dimensionality. Furthermore, the costs are comparable to that of accessing an existing data cube when full materialization is possible."	#*High-Dimensional OLAP: A Minimal Cubing Approach. #@Xiaolei Li, Jiawei Han, Hector Gonzalez #t2004 #cVLDB #index53e9a0eeb7602d97029d75d6 #%53e9b6f3b7602d9704286156 #%53e9bb72b7602d97047b70c0 #%53e9ba0bb7602d970460b494 #%53e9a51db7602d9702e3e678 #%53e9a13fb7602d9702a2cf10 #%53e9b403b7602d9703ef650b #%53e99845b7602d9702073c2e #%53e9ae17b7602d9703825532 #%53e9bb1cb7602d9704757584 #%53e9aedeb7602d970390bad3 #%53e9b102b7602d9703b803ea #%53e9b5ceb7602d9704116fc0 #%53e9be50b7602d9704b0d16a #%53e998cdb7602d9702105a86

Storing the XML in its native format will facilitate new applications that exchange business objects in XML format and query portions of XML documents using XQuery. This paper explores the feasibility of accessing natively-stored XML data through traditional SQL interfaces, called Relational Over XML (ROX), in order to avoid the costly conversion of legacy applications to XQuery. It describes the forces that are driving the industry to evolve toward the ROX scenario as well as some of the issues raised by ROX. The impact of denormalization of data in XML documents is discussed both from a semantic and performance perspective. We also weigh the implications of ROX for manageability and query optimization. We experimentally compared the performance of a prototype of the ROX scenario to today's SQL engines, and found that good performance can be achieved through a combination of utilizing XML's hierarchical storage to store relations \"pre-joined\" as well as creating indices over the remaining join columns. We have developed an experimental framework using DB2 8.1 for Linux, Unix and Windows, and have gathered initial performance results that validate this approach."	#*ROX: Relational Over XML. #@Alan Halverson, Vanja Josifovski, Guy M.

There are two logical ways to deal with this problem. One could generate suboptimal SQL queries using a fairly naive translation algorithm, and then attempt to optimize the resulting SQL; or one could use a more intelligent translation algorithm with the hopes of generating efficient SQL directly. We show that optimizing the SQL after it is generated is problematic, becoming intractable even in simple scenarios; by contrast, designing a translation algorithm that exploits information readily available at translation time is a promising alternative. To support this claim, we present a translation algorithm that exploits translation time information to generate efficient SQL for path expression queries over tree schemas."	#*Efficient XML-to-SQL Query Translation: Where to Add the Intelligence? #@Rajasekar Krishnamurthy, Raghav Kaushik, Jeffrey F.

A growing number of Web information providers post near real-time updates in domains such as auctions, stock markets, bulletin boards, news, weather, roadway conditions, sports scores, etc. External parties often wish to capture this information for a wide variety of purposes ranging from online data mining to automated synthesis of information from multiple sources. There has been a great deal of work on the design of systems that can process streams of data from Web sources, but little attention has been paid to how to produce these data streams, given that Web pages generally require \"pull-based\" access. In this paper we introduce a new general-purpose algorithm for monitoring Web information sources, effectively converting pull-based sources into push-based ones. Our algorithm can be used in conjunction with continuous query systems that assume information is fed into the query engine in a push-based fashion. Ideally, a Web monitoring algorithm for this purpose should achieve two objectives: (1) timeliness and (2) completeness of information captured. However, we demonstrate both analytically and empirically using real-world data that these objectives are fundamentally at odds. When resources available for Web monitoring are limited, and the number of sources to monitor is large, it may be necessary to sacrifice some timeliness to achieve better completeness, or vice versa. To take this fact into account, our algorithm is highly parameterized and targets an application-specified balance between timeliness and completeness. In this paper we formalize the problem of optimizing for a flexible combination of timeliness and completeness, and prove that our parameterized algorithm is a 2- approximation in all cases, and in certain cases is optimal."	#*WIC: A General-Purpose Algorithm for Monitoring Web Information Sources. #@Sandeep Pandey, Kedar Dhamdhere, Christopher Olston #t2004 #cVLDB #index53e9b0c2b7602d9703b34a47 #%53e9b6f3b7602d9704286156 #%53e9addbb7602d97037e6259 #%53e9998bb7602d97021cb146 #%53e99c36b7602d97024e6c3d #%53e9bbeab7602d970484087d #%53e9ba9bb7602d97046c7f67 #%53e99cb5b7602d9702568b3f #%53e9b01db7602d9703a7ab27 #%53e9a75fb7602d9703094d5a #%53e9af13b7602d970394d2ed

Our work is the very first industrial-strength tool that covers the design of as many as four different features, a significant advance to existing tools, which support no more than just indexes and materialized views. Building such a tool is challenging, because of not only the large search space introduced by the interactions among features, but also the extensibility needed by the tool to support additional features in the future. We adopt a novel \"hybrid\" approach in the Design Advisor that allows us to take important interdependencies into account as well as to encapsulate design features as separate components to lower the reengineering cost. The Design Advisor also features a built-in module that automatically reduces the given workload, and therefore provides great scalability for the tool.

It integrates information from the patents with knowledge from biomedical ontologies to create a Semantic Web. Besides keyword search and queries linking the properties specified by one or more RDF triples, the system can discover Semantic Associations between the resources.

A significant problem for these systems is the I/O cost of fetching historical data which inhibits processing of the live data streams. Our solution is to reduce the I/O cost for accessing the archive by retrieving only a reduced (summarized or sampled) version of the historical data. This paper does not propose new summarization or sampling techniques, but rather a framework in which multiple resolutions of summarization/sampling can be generated efficiently. The query engine can select the appropriate level of summarization to use depending on the resources currently available. The central research problem studied is whether to generate the multiple representations of archived data eagerly upon data-arrival, lazily at query-time, or in a hybrid fashion. Concrete techniques for each approach are presented, which are tied to a specific data reduction technique (random sampling). The tradeoffs among the three approaches are studied both analytically and experimentally."	#*Remembrance of Streams Past: Overload-Sensitive Management of Archived Streams. #@Sirish Chandrasekaran, Michael J.

AIDA is developed to help the study of attention disorder in kids. In a different study [1], we collected several immresive sensory data streams from kids monitored in an immersive application called the virtual classroom. This dataset, termed immersidata is used to analyze the behavior of kids in the virtual classroom environment. AIDA's database stores all the geometry of the objects in the virtual classroom environment and their spatio-temporal behavior. In addition, it stores all the immersidata collected from the kids experimenting with the application. AIDA's graphical user interface then supports various spatio-temporal queries on these datasets. Moreover, AIDA replays the immersidata streams as if they are collected in real-time and on which supports various continuous queries. This demonstration is a proof-of-concept prototype of a typical design and development of a domain-specific query and analysis application on the users' interaction data with immersive environments."	#*AIDA: an Adaptive Immersive Data Analyzer. #@Mehdi Sharifzadeh, Cyrus Shahabi, Bahareh Navai, Farid Parvini, Albert A.

The operation combines each point of one dataset with its KNNs in the other dataset and it provides more meaningful query results than the range similarity join. Such an operation is useful for data mining and similarity search. In this paper, we propose a novel KNN-join algorithm, called the Gorder (or the G-ordering KNN) join method. Gorder is a block nested loop join method that exploits sorting, join scheduling and distance computation filtering and reduction to reduce both I/O and CPU costs. It sorts input datasets into the G-order and applied the scheduled block nested loop join on the G-ordered data. The distance computation reduction is employed to further reduce CPU cost. It is simple and yet efficient, and handles high-dimensional data efficiently. Extensive experiments on both synthetic cluster and real life datasets were conducted, and the results illustrate that Gorder is an efficient KNN-join method and outperforms existing methods by a wide margin."	#*Gorder: An Efficient Method for KNN Join Processing. #@Chenyi Xia, Hongjun Lu, Beng Chin Ooi, Jin Hu #t2004 #cVLDB #index53e9a0fcb7602d97029e9bbf #%53e9b6f3b7602d9704286156 #%53e9bce8b7602d9704971003 #%53e99e5bb7602d9702722811 #%53e99813b7602d970202963c #%53e9a682b7602d9702fb8724 #%53e99ec4b7602d970278deeb #%53e9b1ffb7602d9703c97a29 #%53e9ae90b7602d97038aefb8 #%53e9b289b7602d9703d2f078 #%53e99be3b7602d970249027f #%53e9b36db7602d9703e4e603

The cost of a false positive, allowing a launch in spite of a fault, or a false negative, stopping a potentially successful launch, can be measured in the tens of millions of dollars, not including the cost in morale and other more intangible detriments. The Aerospace Corporation is responsible for providing engineering assessments critical to the go/no-go decision for every Department of Defense (DoD) launch vehicle. These assessments are made by constantly monitoring streaming telemetry data in the hours before launch. For this demonstration, we will introduce VizTree, a novel time-series visualization tool to aid the Aerospace analysts who must make these engineering assessments. VizTree was developed at the University of California, Riverside and is unique in that the same tool is used for mining archival data and monitoring incoming live telemetry. Unlike other time series visualization tools, VizTree can scale to very large databases, giving it the potential to be a generally useful data mining and database tool."	#*VizTree: a Tool for Visually Mining and Monitoring Massive Time Series Databases. #@Jessica Lin 0001, Eamonn J.

Stream Data Management Systems process streaming data by executing continuous and historical queries while producing query results in real-time. This benchmark makes it possible to compare the performance characteristics of SDMS' relative to each other and to alternative (e.g., Relational Database) systems. Linear Road has been endorsed as an SDMS benchmark by the developers of both the Aurora [1] (out of Brandeis University, Brown University and MIT) and STREAM [8] (out of Stanford University) stream systems. Linear Road simulates a toll system for the motor vehicle expressways of a large metropolitan area. The tolling system uses \"variable tolling\" [6, 11, 9]: an increasingly prevalent tolling technique that uses such dynamic factors as traffic congestion and accident proximity to calculate toll charges. Linear Road specifies a variable tolling system for a fictional urban area including such features as accident detection and alerts, traffic congestion measurements, toll calculations and historical queries. After specifying the benchmark, we describe experimental results involving two implementations: one using a commercially available Relational Database and the other using Aurora. Our results show that a dedicated Stream Data Management System can outperform a Relational Database by at least a factor of 5 on streaming data applications."	#*Linear Road: A Stream Data Management Benchmark. #@Arvind Arasu, Mitch Cherniack, Eduardo F.

Existing techniques, however, do not optimize accesses to all levels of the memory hierarchy and for all the different workloads, because each storage level uses different technology (cache, memory, disks) and each application accesses data using different patterns. Clotho is a new buffer pool and storage management architecture that decouples in-memory page layout from data organization on non-volatile storage devices to enable independent data layout design at each level of the storage hierarchy. Clotho can maximize cache and memory utilization by (a) transparently using appropriate data layouts in memory and non-volatile storage, and (b) dynamically synthesizing data pages to follow application access patterns at each level as needed. Clotho creates in-memory pages individually tailored for compound and dynamically changing workloads, and enables efficient use of different storage technologies (e.g., disk arrays or MEMS-based storage devices). This paper describes the Clotho design and prototype implementation and evaluates its performance under a variety of workloads using both disk arrays and simulated MEMS-based storage devices."	#*Clotho: Decoupling memory page layout from storage organization. #@Minglong Shao, Jiri Schindler, Steven W.

Some other interactive and internet applications can also benefit from such estimations. While there are a number of estimation techniques proposed in the literature, almost none of them has any guarantee on the estimation accuracy within a given space limit. In addition, most of them assume that the XML data are more or less static, i.e., with few updates. In this paper, we present a framework for XML path selectivity estimation in a dynamic context. Specifically, we propose a novel data structure, bloom histogram, to approximate XML path frequency distribution within a small space budget and to estimate the path selectivity accurately with the bloom histogram. We obtain the upper bound of its estimation error and discuss the trade-offs between the accuracy and the space limit. To support updates of bloom histograms efficiently when underlying XML data change, a dynamic summary layer is used to keep exact or more detailed XML path information. We demonstrate through our extensive experiments that the new solution can achieve significantly higher accuracy with an even smaller space than the previous methods in both static and dynamic environments."	#*Bloom Histogram: Path Selectivity Estimation for XML Data with Updates. #@Wei Wang 0011, Haifeng Jiang, Hongjun Lu, Jeffrey Xu Yu #t2004 #cVLDB #index53e9bd11b7602d97049968a9 #%53e9b6f3b7602d9704286156 #%53e9ab37b7602d97034c376f #%53e99fc9b7602d97028a38ae #%53e99b16b7602d97023a7500 #%53e9a5a8b7602d9702ecfcaa #%53e999d2b7602d97022180fe #%53e9ae17b7602d970382881d #%53e9b326b7602d9703df6eca #%53e9ae48b7602d970385cf97 #%53e99db1b7602d970266d987 #%53e9a76db7602d97030a6a12 #%53e9b5c2b7602d970410f5a3

Erratic data sources, such as stock prices, sensor data, are common and important in practice. However, their erratic patterns of change make caching hard. Stochastic consistency guarantees that errors in cached values of erratic data remain within a user-specified bound, with a user-specified probability. We use a Brownian motion model to capture the behavior of data changes, and use its underlying theory to predict when caches should initiate pulls to refresh cached copies to maintain stochastic consistency. Our approach allows servers to remain totally stateless, thus achieving excellent scalability and reliability. We also discuss a new real-time scheduling approach for servicing pull requests at the server. Our scheduler delivers prompt response whenever possible, and minimizes the aggregate cache-source deviation due to delays during server overload. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our model on real-life datasets, and show that our scheme outperforms current schemes."	#*Stochastic Consistency, and Scalable Pull-Based Caching for Erratic Data Sources. #@Shanzhong Zhu, Chinya V.

Such underestimation often leads to drastically suboptimal query execution plans. We demonstrate cords, an efficient and scalable tool for automatic discovery of correlations and soft functional dependencies between column pairs. We apply cords to real, synthetic, and TPC-H benchmark data, and show that cords discovers correlations in an efficient and scalable manner. The output of cords can be visualized graphically, making cords a useful mining and analysis tool for database administrators. cords ranks the discovered correlated column pairs and recommends to the optimizer a set of statistics to collect for the \"most important\" of the pairs.

With the emergence of hardware and software security elements on client devices, more dynamic client-based access control schemes can be devised. This paper proposes an efficient client-based evaluator of access control rules for regulating access to XML documents. This evaluator takes benefit from a dedicated index to quickly converge towards the authorized parts of a - potentially streaming - document.

However its apparent exponential complexity has significantly limited its applicability to low dimensional datasets. Recently the idea of the coalesced cube was introduced, and showed that high-dimensional coalesced cubes are orders of magnitudes smaller in size than the original data cubes even when they calculate and store every possible aggregation with 100% precision. In this paper we present an analytical framework for estimating the size of coalesced cubes. By using this framework on uniform coalesced cubes we show that their size and the required computation time scales polynomially with the dimensionality of the data set and, therefore, a full data cube at 100% precision is not inherently cursed by high dimensionality. Additionally, we show that such coalesced cubes scale polynomially (and close to linearly) with the number of tuples on the dataset. We were also able to develop an efficient algorithm for estimating the size of coalesced cubes before actually computing them, based only on metadata about the cubes. Finally, we complement our analytical approach with an extensive experimental evaluation using real and synthetic data sets, and demonstrate that not only uniform but also zipfian and real coalesced cubes scale polynomially."	#*The Complexity of Fully Materialized Coalesced Cubes. #@Yannis Sismanis, Nick Roussopoulos #t2004 #cVLDB #index53e99fd6b7602d97028b5e0b #%53e9b6f3b7602d9704286156

Each node is ranked according to its authority with respect to the particular keywords. One can adjust the weight of global importance, the weight of each keyword of the query, the importance of a result actually containing the keywords versus being referenced by nodes containing them, and the volume of authority flow via each type of semantic connection. Novel performance challenges and opportunities are addressed. First, schemas impose constraints on the graph, which are exploited for performance purposes. Second, in order to address the issue of authority ranking with respect to the given keywords (as opposed to Google's global PageRank) we precompute single keyword ObjectRanks and combine them during run time. We conducted user surveys and a set of performance experiments on multiple real and synthetic datasets, to assess the semantic meaningfulness and performance of ObjectRank."	#*ObjectRank: Authority-Based Keyword Search in Databases. #@Andrey Balmin, Vagelis Hristidis, Yannis Papakonstantinou #t2004 #cVLDB #index53e9b082b7602d9703aeb3c1 #%53e9b6f3b7602d9704286156 #%53e9a812b7602d9703157cf9 #%53e997f4b7602d9701ff7484 #%53e9a5c5b7602d9702eede52 #%53e997c6b7602d9701fb8204 #%53e9b983b7602d9704572a9b #%53e9b131b7602d9703bb4ee8 #%53e9a9d3b7602d97033335eb #%53e9bb1cb7602d97047562b9 #%53e9a051b7602d9702937b84 #%53e9ae2eb7602d9703844782 #%53e9a0e6b7602d97029d2483 #%53e9a1c3b7602d9702abdc4a #%53e9aadfb7602d970345ce1b #%53e9b4b4b7602d9703fccc99

In such applications, large quantities of state samples obtained via sensors are streamed to a database. Indexes for moving objects must support queries efficiently, but must also support frequent updates. Indexes based on minimum bounding regions (MBRs) such as the R-tree exhibit high concurrency overheads during node splitting, and each individual update is known to be quite costly. This motivates the design of a solution that enables the B+ -tree to manage moving objects. We represent moving-object locations as vectors that are timestamped based on their update time. By applying a novel linearization technique to these values, it is possible to index the resulting values using a single B+-tree that partitions values according to their timestamp and otherwise preserves spatial proximity. We develop algorithms for range and k nearest neighbor queries, as well as continuous queries. The proposal can be grafted into existing database systems cost effectively. An extensive experimental study explores the performance characteristics of the proposal and also shows that it is capable of substantially outperforming the R-tree based TPR-tree for both single and concurrent access scenarios."	#*Query and Update Efficient B+-Tree Based Indexing of Moving Objects. #@Christian S.

The potential for exchange and retrieval of information is vast and daunting. The key problem in achieving efficient and user-friendly retrieval is the development of a search mechanism to guarantee delivery of minimal irrelevant information (high precision) while insuring relevant information is not overlooked (high recall). The traditional solution employs keyword-based search. The only documents retrieved are those containing user-specified keywords. But many documents convey desired semantic information without containing these keywords. This limitation is frequently addressed through query expansion mechanisms based on the statistical co-occurrence of terms. Recall is increased, but at the expense of deteriorating precision. One can overcome this problem by indexing documents according to context and meaning rather than keywords, although this requires a method of converting words to meanings and the creation of a meaning-based index structure. We have solved the problem of an index structure through the design and implementation of a concept-based model using domain-dependent ontologies. An ontology is a collection of concepts and their interrelationships that provide an abstract view of an application domain. With regard to converting words to meaning, the key issue is to identify appropriate concepts that both describe and identify documents as well as language employed in user requests. This paper describes an automatic mechanism for selecting these concepts. An important novelty is a scalable disambiguation algorithm that prunes irrelevant concepts and allows relevant ones to associate with documents and participate in query generation. We also propose an automatic query expansion mechanism that deals with user requests expressed in natural language. This mechanism generates database queries with appropriate and relevant expansion through knowledge encoded in ontology form. Focusing on audio data, we have constructed a demonstration prototype. We have experimentally and analytically shown that our model, compared to keyword search, achieves a significantly higher degree of precision and recall. The techniques employed can be applied to the problem of information selection in all media types."	#*Retrieval effectiveness of an ontology-based model for information selection. #@Latifur Khan, Dennis McLeod, Eduard H.

More specifically, these services may capture the movements and requests of their users in multidimensional databases, i.e., data warehouses, and content delivery may be based on the results of complex queries on these data warehouses. Such queries aggregate detailed data in order to find useful patterns, e.g., in the interaction of a particular user with the services.The application of multidimensional technology in this context poses a range of new challenges. The specific challenge addressed here concerns the provision of an appropriate multidimensional data model. In particular, the paper extends an existing multidimensional data model and algebraic query language to accommodate spatial values that exhibit partial containment relationships instead of the total containment relationships normally assumed in multidimensional data models. Partial containment introduces imprecision in aggregation paths. The paper proposes a method for evaluating the imprecision of such paths. The paper also offers transformations of dimension hierarchies with partial containment relationships to simple hierarchies, to which existing precomputation techniques are applicable."	#*Multidimensional data modeling for location-based services. #@Christian S.

In order to maintain such materialized views, maintenance queries need to be sent to information sources by the data warehouse management system. Due to the independence of the information sources and the data warehouse, concurrency issues are raised between the maintenance queries and the local update transactions at each information source. Recent solutions such as ECA and Strobe tackle such concurrent maintenance, however with the requirement of quiescence of the information sources. SWEEP and POSSE overcome this limitation by decomposing the global maintenance query into smaller subqueries to be sent to every information source and then performing conflict correction locally at the data warehouse. Note that all these previous approaches handle the data updates one at a time. Hence either some of the information sources or the data warehouse is likely to be idle during most of the maintenance process. In this paper, we propose that a set of updates should be maintained in parallel by several concurrent maintenance processes so that both the information sources as well as the warehouse would be utilized more fully throughout the maintenance process. This parallelism should then improve the overall maintenance performance. For this we have developed a parallel view maintenance algorithm, called PVM, that substantially improves upon the performance of previous maintenance approaches by handling a set of data updates at the same time. The parallel handling of a set of updates is orthogonal to the particular maintenance algorithm applied to the handling of each individual update. In order to perform parallel view maintenance, we have identified two critical issues that must be overcome: (1) detecting maintenance-concurrent data updates in a parallel mode and (2) correcting the problem that the data warehouse commit order may not correspond to the data warehouse update processing order due to parallel maintenance handling. In this work, we provide solutions to both issues. For the former, we insert a middle-layer timestamp assignment module for detecting maintenance-concurrent data updates without requiring any global clock synchronization. For the latter, we introduce the negative counter concept to solve the problem of variant orders of committing effects of data updates to the data warehouse. We provide a proof of the correctness of PVM that guarantees that our strategy indeed generates the correct final data warehouse state. We have implemented both SWEEP and PVM in our EVE data warehousing system. Our performance study demonstrates that a manyfold performance improvement is achieved by PVM over SWEEP."	#*Parallel multisource view maintenance. #@Xin Zhang 0002, Lingli Ding, Elke A.

In this paper, we study how to evolve a query cost model to capture a slowly-changing dynamic MDBS environment so that the cost model is kept up-to-date all the time. Two novel evolutionary techniques, i.e., the shifting method and the block-moving method, are proposed. The former updates a cost model by taking up-to-date information from a new sample query into consideration at each step, while the latter considers a block (batch) of new sample queries at each step. The relevant issues, including derivation of recurrence updating formulas, development of efficient algorithms, analysis and comparison of complexities, and design of an integrated scheme to apply the two methods adaptively, are studied. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed techniques are quite promising in maintaining accurate cost models efficiently for a slowly changing dynamic MDBS environment. Besides the application to MDBSs, the proposed techniques can also be applied to the automatic maintenance of cost models in self-managing database systems."	#*Evolutionary techniques for updating query cost models in a dynamic multidatabase environment. #@Amira Rahal, Qiang Zhu, Per-Åke Larson #t2004 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b9f5b7602d97045ef302 #%53e9b7eeb7602d97043a0e20 #%53e9a987b7602d97032e43db #%53e99ad7b7602d9702359056 #%53e99acab7602d970234af19 #%53e9a25cb7602d9702b61fef #%53e9b30ab7602d9703dd12f6 #%53e9be72b7602d9704b34e8f #%53e9abf1b7602d97035ace6a #%53e9b44bb7602d9703f44f90 #%53e9a472b7602d9702d93823 #%53e9aa2cb7602d970339ce02 #%53e9a169b7602d9702a5b505 #%53e9ac8fb7602d9703664ef3 #%53e9bb53b7602d9704793bc1 #%53e9b14bb7602d9703bcd3ec

Based on Object-Process Methodology (OPM), which enables modeling of systems in a single graphic and textual model, ViSWeb provides for representation of knowledge over the Web in a unified way that caters to human perceptions while also being machine processable. The advantages of the ViSWeb approach include equivalent graphic-text knowledge representation, visual navigability, semantic sentence interpretation, specification of system dynamics, and complexity management. Arguing against the claim that humans and machines need to look at different knowledge representation formats, the principles and basics of various graphic and textual knowledge representations are presented and examined as candidates for ViSWeb foundation. Since OPM is shown to be most adequate for the task, ViSWeb is developed as an OPM-based layer on top of XML/RDF/OWL to express knowledge visually and in natural language. Both the graphic and the textual representations are strictly equivalent. Being intuitive yet formal, they are not only understandable to humans but are also amenable to computer processing. The ability to use such bimodal knowledge representation is potentially a major step forward in the evolution of the Semantic Web."	#*ViSWeb - the Visual Semantic Web: unifying human and machine knowledge representations with Object-Process Methodology. #@Dov Dori #t2004 #cVLDB J. #index53e9bb7ab7602d97047bf957 #%53e9b3bcb7602d9703ea2715 #%53e9ac62b7602d970363466f #%53e9b6abb7602d970422cb2c #%53e9a480b7602d9702d9cf7b #%53e9b355b7602d9703e2de74 #%53e99efab7602d97027c61c4

This tool follows the observation that in many cases there is a gap between current tools that enable one to react to a single event (following the ECA: event-condition-action paradigm) and the reality in which a single event may not require any reaction; however, the reaction should be given to patterns over the event history.The concept of presented in this paper extends the concept of in its expressive power, flexibility, and usability.

By varying the tuning “knob”, $\\theta$, we can obtain different families of iMinMax structures that are optimized for different distributions of data sets. The transformed data can then be indexed using existing single-dimensional indexing structures such as the B+-trees. Queries in the high-dimensional space have to be transformed into queries in the single-dimensional space and evaluated there. We present efficient algorithms for evaluating window queries as range queries on the single-dimensional space. We conducted an extensive performance study to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. Our results show that iMinMax($\\theta$) outperforms existing techniques, including the Pyramid scheme and VA-file, by a wide margin. We then describe how iMinMax could be used in approximate K-nearest neighbor (KNN) search, and we present a comparative study against the recently proposed iDistance, a specialized KNN indexing method."	#*Querying high-dimensional data in single-dimensional space. #@Cui Yu, Stéphane Bressan, Beng Chin Ooi, Kian-Lee Tan #t2004 #cVLDB J. #index53e9a0f3b7602d97029dccdb #%53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6116 #%53e997f1b7602d9701fee590 #%53e99885b7602d97020be910 #%53e999c3b7602d970220accb #%53e9b917b7602d97044fe9d0 #%53e99813b7602d970202963c #%53e9b260b7602d9703d01a49 #%53e9b108b7602d9703b87088 #%53e99be3b7602d970249027f #%53e9abf1b7602d97035b2874 #%53e9a074b7602d970295e95e #%53e999aeb7602d97021f4833 #%53e99d8fb7602d970264e9a4

We partition data into equiwidth buckets and further partition dense buckets into subbuckets as needed by allocating and reclaiming memory space. The bucketing process dynamically adapts to the input order and distribution of input datasets. The histograms of the buckets and subbuckets are stored in our new data structure called structure trees. A recent selection algorithm based on regular sampling is generalized and its analysis extended. We have also compared our new algorithms with this generalized algorithm and several other recent algorithms. Experimental results show that our new algorithms significantly outperform prior ones not only in the runtime but also in accuracy."	#*Evaluating holistic aggregators efficiently for very large datasets. #@Lixin Fu, Sanguthevar Rajasekaran #t2004 #cVLDB J. #index53e9b2d2b7602d9703d82ca4 #%53e998f6b7602d970213460b #%53e9b19cb7602d9703c25aca #%53e9af12b7602d97039487c6 #%53e997c6b7602d9701fb8204 #%53e9be4ab7602d9704b095b0 #%53e9a011b7602d97028f2d82 #%53e9a099b7602d97029828fd #%53e9ae17b7602d9703825532 #%53e9b5a2b7602d97040e9ba6
